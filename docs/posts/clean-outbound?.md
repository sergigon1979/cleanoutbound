# Clean Outbound?

**Why outbound is dirty, and clean outbound is just a beautiful idea**

Sales is essential and fundamentally good. At its core, it's about helping people discover, understand, and ultimately buy products that deliver real value. Sales acts as a catalyst: it accelerates value reaching the people who need it, shortening the gap between what a product promises and what a customer actually experiences. The world simply cannot function without sales.

And yet, sales often ends up dirty, and cold outbound sales particularly so. It creates what economists call a negative externality: a cost imposed on third parties who neither chose nor benefit from the transaction. A chemical plant discharges waste into the river; the cost is borne by communities downstream. A nightclub generates profit for its owners and entertainment for its customers, while neighbors, who didn't vote for any of it, lie awake at 3 AM.

Outbound sales works the same way. Overflowing inboxes, interrupted conversations, minutes stolen from concentration. Individually trivial. Multiplied millions of times, a burden carried by society, imposed without consent. Like those neighbors kept up by the nightclub.

Outbound programs get the same cost-benefit treatment as everything else. On one side, the costs: data, tools, people, overhead. On the other, the returns: deals closed, revenue generated. Success means the ratio hits some target—usually a multiple of lifetime value over acquisition cost.

What's never tallied in that equation: the costs outbound pushes onto everyone else. Factor them in, and outbound can't be run the same way.

**It doesn't have to be this way. Does it?**

It does. 

Granted, outbound can never be truly clean. Not without consent. But most people would agree that some friction, and even cost-shifting, is acceptable in exchange for the broad value commerce creates. What they object to is practices that feel truly extractive, like endless email sequencing or automated follow-ups that run on autopilot for months.

Clean outbound is the idea that you don't have to be extractive to be effective. Send less, but send better, and the increase in win rate will compensate for the reduced volume. If most companies don't operate this way, it must be because doing so is difficult. It requires better tools, more research and greater skill, so they're taking an easier path.

It doesn't work that way. Better tools don't lead to more discipline. They lead to more volume. You get access to better data and suddenly there are more people worth contacting. You get automated sequences and one person can do what five once did. But you have five. You get AI-written copy and the bottleneck of composition disappears. At each step, you could bank the efficiency. But why would you? More reach is more opportunity. Restraint leaves money on the table.

Everyone makes the same choice. Each efficiency gain gets converted into more output. When steam engines became more efficient, coal consumption rose. When email became cheaper to send well, more email got sent.

The result is a channel that degrades steadily. When recipients face a hundred emails that look thoughtful, they stop distinguishing. Quality loses its ability to signal quality. Neither the sender who invests in relevance nor the sender who invests in volume can break through. Eventually all messages become indistinguishable, and the channel ceases to work for anyone.

Scholars have described and named these dynamics—the Jevons paradox, the tragedy of the commons—but the pattern in outbound sales is simply this: efficiency spurs volume, volume is destroying the shared resource.

Individual rationality, collective ruin. Incentives and structure make this outcome feel inevitable.

This project explores how we got here: the arms race between senders and filters, the regulatory choices that left email unprotected, the economic logic that made volume the default. And what happens when a channel collapses, taking with it the companies that still rely on it and the founders for whom it was the default path to growth.
