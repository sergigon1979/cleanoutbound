Clean Outbound is where these two currents meet. </p> <p> I don\u2019t know if this is a blog, or something else entirely. For now, it\u2019s a set of reflections, curious to see where they lead. </p>"},{"location":"posts/degrees-of-clean/","title":"Degrees of Clean","text":"<p>Why Clean Sales is a ladder, not a switch \u2014 and how to climb it</p> <p>Published: August 18, 2025</p> <p>In Outbound is Dirty, I compared conventional outbound sales to a poorly regulated factory: profitable for the operator, costly for everyone else. The costs take the form of an attention tax, minutes of focus taken from unwilling recipients of poorly targeted emails. These recipients are, in effect, subsidising the sender\u2019s business.</p> <p>I cast the problem as a binary: your outbound is either \u201cdirty\u201d or \u201cclean.\u201d It was a convenient simplification, but reality is less tidy. Cleanliness is not a switch you flip. It is a ladder you climb, one rung or one step at a time. Some systems burn dirtier than others. The intelligent goal is not to reach some mythical top rung of perfect cleanliness, which would perhaps mean no selling at all. The goal is to keep climbing toward cleaner operation.</p> <p>You can see the same pattern in energy generation. At the bottom step: wood fires, leaving soot on walls, clothes, and lungs. We climbed to coal: cleaner and more efficient than wood, but whole cities still wore a permanent gray coat. Then came natural gas: cleaner still, producing more heat per unit and at a lower cost, though still a fossil fuel with significant emissions, methane leakage during extraction, and reliance on finite reserves. Now we climb toward solar. Not perfect; it uses land, requires manufacturing, and recycling panels is a challenge. Yet it is vastly cleaner than anything below it and, in many cases, already cheaper.</p> <p>Moving up the ladder usually means a better balance of cost and cleanliness. Some shifts are obvious. Solar beats coal on both measures. Others are harder to call. Old fuels can linger through habit, inertia, and sunk costs, even when cleaner, cheaper options exist.</p> <p>Sales has its own version of the ladder. The bottom steps are mass-blast, low-precision, low-value tactics. Higher up are systems that aim precisely, deliver genuine value per touch, and know when to stop. They are cleaner and they work better. Yet, as in energy, the lower steps still dominate the grid.</p> <p>Why Bother Climbing</p> <p>One reason to climb is sustainability.</p> <p>Hannah Ritchie, in Not the End of the World, defines it as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. For most of history, we failed at the first part: we could not meet our own needs. Now we can. But we do it by consuming the very systems that future generations will rely on.</p> <p>Sales faces the same structural flaw. A company can meet this quarter\u2019s target through mass outreach, misaligned pitches, and brute-force persistence. The tactic works, but only by degrading the channel itself \u2014 burning trust, lowering response rates, and making the next prospect that much harder to reach. It\u2019s the sales equivalent of strip-mining: the numbers look great today, but you\u2019re standing in a field of churned mud wondering where the next vein is.</p> <p>Ritchie\u2019s argument is that our generation is the first with the means to break this pattern. The parallel in sales is exact. We have the measurement to see the damage, and the tools to reduce it without reducing results. The question is no longer whether it can be done, but whether we choose to keep digging holes or start building something that lasts. (Spoiler alert: AI will help.)</p> <p>Ways of Being Clean</p> <p>Cleanliness isn\u2019t binary, and it isn\u2019t measured in only one way.</p> <p>In energy, cleanliness is measured on several axes: carbon emissions, land use, deaths per terawatt-hour, toxic waste. Each is a separate measure of harm. Progress means reducing the impact on each axis, even if none can be brought to zero.</p> <p>Sales has its own axes of cleanliness. Dirty systems impose the highest attention cost \u2014 consuming large amounts of human focus for little useful return. The goal is to meet sales targets while lowering that cost. Greater precision in targeting. Higher density of value in every contact. Messages that are clear. An approach that is honest and respectful. Improving on these dimensions reduces the cost imposed on the market and makes results more durable.</p> <p>Precision: Aim Before You Fire</p> <p>Dirty sales systems spray attention costs across people who were never going to buy. Precision reduces that waste.</p> <p>I recently spoke with a sales rep selling an outbound tool. He proudly told me it delivered \u201cindustry-beating\u201d reply rates of 5%. For every 5 people who responded, there were 95 who would rather not have received the email at all. That\u2019s considered best in class.</p> <p>The fix isn\u2019t just \u201cbetter lists.\u201d It\u2019s understanding why a prospect might be in-market now. In sales tech, this gets lumped under \u201cintent signals,\u201d but not all intent is equal. True intent is direct evidence of active interest or relevant need: a public statement from the buyer, a job posting that signals a capability gap, a technology change you know creates pain you can solve.</p> <p>What often gets sold as \u201cintent\u201d is far weaker: someone at the company read a vaguely related article, or a contact clicked on a link in a generic newsletter. Those can help with prioritisation, but they\u2019re not reasons to reach out. When your definition of intent is loose, you end up creating noise that drowns out the signal.</p> <p>Precision means reserving the interruption for when you have a specific, time-sensitive reason to believe you can help. Every touch still spends attention, but when you fire only on true intent, the cost is far more likely to generate value \u2014 for you and for the buyer.</p> <p>Value Density: Paying Back Attention</p> <p>Once you\u2019ve aimed correctly, the interaction must be worth the prospect\u2019s time. Value Density is the ratio of insight delivered to attention consumed. In a clean system, that ratio is always in focus.</p> <p>Consider a discovery call. In the low-density version, the seller works through a script. The buyer answers questions, the clock runs out, and they leave knowing nothing new. Thirty minutes gone \u2014 a pure attention tax.</p> <p>In the high-density version, the seller arrives with context. They share observations from similar companies, highlight a risk the buyer hasn\u2019t considered, suggest a quick check the team can run, or link a recent move to a likely consequence. The buyer leaves better informed, whether or not they are a fit.</p> <p>Both calls meet the seller\u2019s need for qualification. Only one repays the attention it costs.</p> <p>Clarity: Don\u2019t Make Them Pay Twice</p> <p>Every message already costs attention. If it\u2019s unclear, you add a second toll, the mental effort to figure out what you meant.</p> <p>That second toll is rarely obvious, but the reader feels it. It\u2019s that moment when they have to stop, re-read, and piece together your point. Even if they get there, you\u2019ve made them work for something they didn\u2019t ask for in the first place.</p> <p>The empathetic move is to carry that burden yourself. Use their vocabulary, put the point first, make the next step obvious.</p> <p>Honesty</p> <p>The fake email thread. Subject line starts with \u201cRE:\u201d to look like you\u2019re replying to something they sent. You\u2019re not. There\u2019s no prior exchange.</p> <p>Sadly, it works. Opens go up. Some people stay oblivious and a few even convert. But seriously \u2014 how do you look at yourself in the mirror?</p> <p>Respect: Knowing When to Stop</p> <p>No is no. It goes \u2014 should go \u2014 without saying. But if the prospect has to say it out loud, you weren\u2019t listening.</p> <p>If you want to see how deep the madness runs, Google \u201cideal number of touches in an email sequence\u00b9.\u201d You\u2019ll find entire articles explaining why the \u201csweet spot\u201d is somewhere between five and eight touches. Fewer than that and you\u2019re \u201cgiving up too early.\u201d Most replies, we\u2019re told, come from later touches. That might be optimal if your only metric is overall reply rate. It\u2019s far less optimal if you care about the attention tax you impose on society, let alone reputational costs.</p> <p>I think even three is pushing it, even when I\u2019m convinced the person would benefit from hearing from me. Every time an email is ignored is another clue the recipient doesn\u2019t give a shit \u2014 so why keep pressing?</p> <p>\u00b9 There\u2019s a whole industry of tools that will happily automate this for you \u2014 which is basically adding insult to injury, because the sender isn\u2019t even taking the time to notice, let alone care, that you\u2019re not interested.</p> <p>The Work</p> <p>If climbing this ladder feels like a lot of work, that\u2019s because it is.</p> <p>Dirty sales is easy. It\u2019s the path of least resistance \u2014 a system optimised for the sender\u2019s convenience. A numbers game played with other people\u2019s time.</p> <p>Clean sales is harder. It asks for thought, discipline, and real effort. But that effort isn\u2019t a cost; it\u2019s a signal. It says you respect the person on the other end. That you see them as a potential partner, not just an entry in your CRM. It is, in short, an act of empathy.</p> <p>And the work pays. The return isn\u2019t just feeling good about yourself; it\u2019s a business that lasts. Sustainable results. A brand that survives the next quarter. A profession that pulls in great people instead of chewing them up.</p> <p>The lazy path will always be there, waiting. The better one won\u2019t build itself.</p> <p>(Alright, technically AI can do some of the heavy lifting.

But these guardians created a new ritual for entry: a theater of fake civility, performed by machines for machines, before a single human is involved. </p> <p>A fork in the road</p> <p>For a business sending email, there are two realities. In the first, a new employee can send  a handful of carefully crafted messages to relevant contacts and expect them to be  delivered. In the second, the same act requires a weeks-long initiation: a ritual of simulated  exchanges performed before a machine that must learn to trust you. The difference between  these two realities is not how legitimate the business is, but how much email it plans to send.  The practice that governs the second reality is known as email warming. </p> <p>Sender reputation is \u2018assumed guilty\u2019</p> <p>At its core, this divergence is a response to how modern email systems police their  networks. Mailbox providers like Google and Microsoft have no history of a new domain\u2019s  behavior. Their algorithms rely heavily on sender reputation, which for a new domain is  non-existent. Any early negative signals are catastrophic, as reputation is cumulative but  hard to repair. </p> <p>A sender\u2019s score is built from a range of signals, including: </p> <ul> <li>Engagement metrics: opens, replies, and read times.  </li> <li>Negative signals: spam complaints and high bounce rates.  </li> <li>Technical authentication: SPF (verifies who can send from your domain), DKIM  (signs messages so they can\u2019t be altered), and DMARC (tells providers what to do if  those checks fail).  </li> <li>Volume and velocity: sudden spikes in sending activity are a major red flag.  </li> </ul> <p>Without a positive history, a high-volume campaign is immediately flagged as suspicious,  condemning messages to the junk folder. </p> <p>Email warming: a rehearsal for reputation</p> <p>Email warming is the process of methodically building a positive reputation before launching a large-scale campaign. </p> <p>It is, in essence, a rehearsal staged to train the inbox algorithms to trust you. Since the precise rules of the algorithms are opaque, the industry has reverse-engineered a set of best practices that imitate the signals of a trusted sender. This shared wisdom has crystallized into something of a ritual that mimics the behavior of a healthy domain over time:</p> <ul> <li>Start with a low volume of emails and increase it gradually.  </li> <li>Send to a network of engaged inboxes that are programmed to open, reply, and  mark emails as important.  </li> <li>Maintain a near-zero bounce rate by using verified lists of these friendly inboxes.  </li> </ul> <p>Many modern sales tools \u2014 including Warmup Inbox, Lemwarm, Instantly, and Smartlead, to  name just a few \u2014 automate this process, creating \u201creply loops\u201d that simulate natural,  two-way conversations and generate the positive engagement metrics algorithms look for.  </p> <p>Why new domains are required</p> <p>Outbound teams rely on email warming because they rarely send from their primary  company domain. The primary domain\u2019s reputation is too valuable to risk on high-volume  outbound. Instead, they register secondary domains (e.g., try-clean.com, get-outbound.io)  specifically for outreach. Each of these new domains starts with zero reputation and must be  warmed individually before being put into rotation.  </p> <p>The same is true for startups sending outbound for the first time. For them, the ritual is  almost literal: a necessary initiation before they can reach a single real prospect.  </p> <p>A simple safeguard becomes the foundation for an entire manufacturing process.  </p> <p>The industry: outbound agencies and farms</p> <p>As companies chased predictable pipeline, a parallel industry emerged to operationalize it.  Outbound agencies and so-called \u201cfarms\u201d manage outreach for dozens of clients at once,  running hundreds of mailboxes across secondary domains. Each inbox must be warmed,  maintained, and retired as reputation fades. A production line of synthetic correspondence.  This isn\u2019t a side effect of bad actors; it\u2019s the logical outcome of trying to scale a behavior that  was never meant to scale. In this economy, trust itself becomes an inventory that is  generated, consumed, and replenished by machines.  </p> <p>In my experience since first stepping into a sales leadership role, roughly two out of every  three unsolicited emails I receive come from these outbound farms, a statistic likely familiar  to anyone with a public-facing role today.  </p> <p>The first Internet: a high-trust network</p> <p>This entire cycle of algorithmic defense and circumvention stems from the original architecture of email. The underlying protocol, SMTP, was created by the same research community that built and ran the ARPANET \u2014 the embryo of the internet, a small high-trust network where participants knew each other by name \u2014 and was designed with no built-in identity layer.</p> <p>(See The Day of the Blast for how that same network produced the first mass email.)</p> <p>In response to the flood of spam that exploited this vulnerability, providers have layered on opaque, machine-learning filters to police the commons. If the rules for gaining trust were transparent, they would be immediately gamed. The result is a system where the only way to prove trustworthiness at scale is to successfully simulate it first.</p> <p>The cost of scaling beyond consent</p> <p>Ultimately, the need for email warming is a declaration of intent. A business that uses email as it was originally conceived, for relevant communication that people would expect to receive, has no need for it. Their natural, human-scale behavior builds reputation organically.</p> <p>The warming ritual exists only to build one thing: a reservoir of algorithmic trust, to be spent on  high-volume reach the moment the company decides to flip the switch. It is the rite of passage  every company must pass through to scale beyond consent. The company pays the cost of this  ritual only once. From then on, the burden is forever externalized, becoming an attention tax  collected on everyone else.  </p>","tags":["email","deliverability","sales","automation","ethics"]},{"location":"posts/intent-data/","title":"Explainer: Intent Data","text":"<p>What is \"Intent Data\", how is it manufactured, and why is it (probably) wrong most of the time.</p> <p>Published: October 23, 2025</p> <p> The promise of intent data is to replace guesswork with a clear signal of who will buy next. The flaw in the promise is that this signal is not a direct measurement of interest, but a low-fidelity guess dressed up to look like a data point worth acting on. </p> <p>The next buyer question</p> <p>Every go-to-market leader is vexed by the same question: who is ready to buy right now?  </p> <p>In pursuit of an answer, an industry formed around an irresistible promise: the power to see tomorrow\u2019s buyers before they raise their hands, to replace guesswork with data. This promise has fueled a multi-billion dollar market, with over 70% of B2B go-to-market teams now using intent data in some form.  </p> <p>Yet for a product this valuable, its origins are surprisingly opaque. To understand what\u2019s really being sold, it helps to follow the trail back to its source.  </p> <p>Bidstream: the raw material</p> <p>The story begins, unexpectedly, in advertising.  </p> <p>When a webpage loads, the empty rectangle where an advert will appear doesn\u2019t yet have a buyer. In the milliseconds before it becomes visible, an automated auction takes place. Hundreds of bidders receive a tiny packet of data \u2014 the page\u2019s topic, device type, rough location, and IP address \u2014 and decide whether to bid.  </p> <p>It\u2019s as if a newspaper could sell its ad space while you\u2019re reading it, adjusting the price depending on what section you\u2019ve opened and where you\u2019re sitting. If the system sees you\u2019re reading in Florida in July, the winning bid might be for air conditioners.  </p> <p>These auctions create what\u2019s known as the bidstream: a torrent of metadata describing who looked at what, when, and from where. It was designed to price attention in real time. But publishers realised the by-product \u2014 the bidstream itself \u2014 had value. Each auction produces a small data packet with the page, device, and location details used to price the impression. This torrent then flows into the data market through a web of intermediaries \u2014 brokers and platforms that buy, aggregate, and resell it to enrichment firms searching for patterns of commercial intent.  </p> <p>Guessing and dressing identities</p> <p>The enrichment vendors that buy these feeds face a simple obstacle: the data show what pages were viewed, but not who viewed them. To turn a potential intent signal into something a marketeer or salesperson can act on, they must first guess which company it came from.  </p> <p>That task falls to IP-mapping vendors like KickFire, Clearbit Reveal, and Leadfeeder. They maintain huge databases linking IP address ranges to corporate networks. Some of those links come from public routing records \u2014 the internet\u2019s address book \u2014 but most are inferred from observation. If traffic from a certain range keeps hitting both Salesforce documentation and Salesforce\u2019s careers page, the algorithm quietly labels that network \u201cSalesforce.\u201d  </p> <p>Once the web traffic is associated with companies, enrichment firms take over. They classify the pages being read into business topics like \u201cHR system migration,\u201d \u201cpayroll software,\u201d or \u201cWorkday alternatives.\u201d When enough visits from one network cluster around a theme, the system records a \u201ctopic surge.\u201d Some vendors go further, layering in other data points\u2014hiring trends, funding rounds, technology installs\u2014to build what they call \"composite intent signals\", the claim being that combining many weak indicators yields a stronger, more reliable signal.</p> <p>To put a bow on it</p> <p>By now, the data has already passed through several hands. The ad exchange sells the packet, the broker sells the feed, and a chain of specialists reshapes it: IP-mapping firms guess which company each address belongs to; enrichment vendors classify pages into business topics and aggregate these patterns into the composite \u201cintent\u201d scores. </p> <p>And finally, platform integrators like ZoomInfo and 6sense package this manufactured signal for go-to-market teams. Marketing uses it for account-based targeting; sales uses it to prioritise outreach. The dashboard turns those probabilities into something that looks decisive: \u201cAcme Manufacturing - HR system migration interest up 28% week over week\u201d.</p> <p>Acme Manufacturing</p> <p>Lean back and watch the full motion unfold.  </p> <p>A job candidate, connected to the guest Wi-Fi while waiting in the lobby of Acme Manufacturing, scrolls through the websites of Workday and BambooHR: two other firms where he\u2019s also applied for roles.  </p> <p>Each site he visits fires a bidstream ping. An ad exchange broadcasts the details; a data broker captures the packet and sells the feed. Days later, at an enrichment firm, that lobby Wi-Fi\u2019s IP address is matched to Acme Manufacturing, the candidate\u2019s browsing is tagged as corporate-level interest in \u201cHR system migration,\u201d and the activity registers as a surge.  </p> <p>The surge alert enters BambooHR\u2019s marketing automation system, where Acme Manufacturing\u2019s account score ticks upward, finally hitting some arbitrary threshold, which flags it as a Marketing-Qualified Account and routes it to Sales. A task is queued in the CRM for John, an SDR at BambooHR. After returning from his coffee break, he places a call.  </p> <p>The phone rings in the office of Acme\u2019s Head of People Ops, the very manager who interviewed the candidate. She picks up, still drafting a polite rejection note, and hears:  </p> <p>\u201cI noticed you\u2019re exploring new HR systems.\u201d  </p> <p>Where the guesswork breaks</p> <p>The common critique of intent data is that its signal is weak because context is lost at each step: turning a page view into an IP address, an IP into a company, and a company into a trend. But this framing is too generous. It implies a real, person-level signal existed at the start, only to be stripped of its meaning.  </p> <p>The opposite happens. The process begins with something inherently indeterminate \u2014 anonymous web traffic\u00b9 \u2014 and adds layers of conjecture. Fidelity isn\u2019t lost; it\u2019s invented, dressing up a statistical guess until it looks like a data point worth acting on.  </p> <p>The weakest link is identity mismatch, the attempt to map that anonymous web traffic to a specific company. Audits put accuracy near 40\u201350%, far below the 80\u201390% vendors claim. Remote work, shared offices, and cloud infrastructure all blur IP identity. Two providers may disagree on which company an IP belongs to, so the same browsing activity can register as intent from entirely different firms. And even when they\u2019re right, the match only narrows the activity to a company, never to a person.  </p> <p>The next distortion is manufactured statistical certainty. Composite scoring blends different data types \u2014 hiring surges, funding rounds, new software installs \u2014 to make a weak signal look stronger. But these signals are rarely independent. A company that has just raised funding is also likely to be hiring and buying software. Since the clues point to the same underlying event, they don\u2019t triangulate a target, they simply reinforce one assumption. The model grows more confident without becoming more accurate, mistaking correlation for certainty.</p> <p>Another flaw is semantic drift in topic detection. Every \u201csurge\u201d depends on vendor-specific taxonomies \u2014 \u201cHR software,\u201d \u201ccontract management,\u201d \u201ccloud migration\u201d \u2014 derived from automated classifiers that interpret page text and metadata. Vendors revise these opaque taxonomies without notice, so changes in classification often reflect model drift, not market behaviour. A single page can be labeled differently across providers or model versions, creating semantic drift that mirrors shifts in the classifier, not in buyer intent.  </p> <p>The final limitation is latency. The auction that produces the bidstream happens in milliseconds; the enrichment and reporting cycle takes days or weeks. By the time a score appears in a dashboard, the behaviour it describes is often already stale.  </p> <p> \u00b9 A curated alternative to the raw bidstream is the data cooperative model, often associated with vendors like Bombora. In this model, a network of B2B publishers agrees to share anonymized visitor data, yielding a higher-quality signal about the topic being researched (the what). Crucially, however, it still depends on the same probabilistic IP-to-company mapping to determine where that research originates (the who), and therefore does not solve the fundamental identity and context challenges outlined here. </p> <p>The industrial logic</p> <p>Yet the system endures, and for rational reasons. Weak signals are not worthless. In a high-volume outbound model, even a tiny probabilistic edge compounds at scale. A one- or two-point lift in response rate, spread across thousands of prospects, pays for itself many times over.  </p> <p>That\u2019s why intent data fits so neatly into the industrial go-to-market philosophy: it offers direction: just enough to keep the outbound factory running, turning a small statistical edge into a licence for volume.  </p> <p>The vanishing raw material</p> <p>The industry has long weathered scrutiny over the unreliability of its manufactured signals. But it now faces a truly existential threat, one that targets not the quality of the signal, but its very existence. The entire market was built on a single, fragile assumption: that the torrent of human curiosity, expressed as page views, would flow forever.  </p> <p>That assumption is now breaking.  </p> <p>As AI assistants handle more of the early research process, users get answers without opening a page. In 2024, SparkToro and SimilarWeb found that more than 65% of Google searches ended without a click \u2014 a record high \u2014 and early evidence suggests AI answer boxes will push that number higher still. Publishers see the same trend: Semrush and Parse.ly report year-on-year declines in organic traffic across B2B and informational sites.  </p> <p>For business buyers, the shift is sharper. A procurement manager who once searched \u201cbest contract-management software\u201d now asks ChatGPT or Claude and receives a synthesised answer instantly. No page view means no auction, no bidstream, and nothing to map.  </p> <p>This shift to conversational AI presents a fundamental challenge. Unlike the open web, where actions are public by default, these new interfaces are private. As research activity moves from public web pages to private AI chats, the visibility required for bidstream auctions disappears.  </p> <p>The raw material of this market is human curiosity expressed as a page view, and the industry is running out of curiosity to sell.</p>","tags":["intent","data","sales","analytics","ethics"]},{"location":"posts/outbound-is-dirty/","title":"Outbound is Dirty","text":"<p>Modern cold outbound sales is a dirty business. But it doesn't have to be.</p> <p>Published: August 7, 2025</p> <p>Sales, as a human occupation, is essential and fundamentally good. At its core, sales is about helping people discover, understand, and ultimately buy the products or solutions a company offers. The very fact that customers willingly complete these transactions is proof enough that these products deliver real value. Seen this way, sales acts as a lubricant, a catalyst: it shortens the gap between potential value\u2014the promise of what the product could do\u2014and realized value, which the customer experiences once they purchase and use it.</p> <p>The world simply cannot function without sales.</p> <p>And yet, sales often ends up dirty, and cold outbound sales is particularly so. It generates pollution in the same way a chemical plant produces waste. To manufacture a profitable compound, the factory inevitably creates byproducts. When that waste is discharged into a river, the cost isn\u2019t borne by the factory but passed downstream to communities living beside it.</p> <p>Economists call this a negative externality: a cost imposed on third parties who neither chose nor benefit from the transaction.</p> <p>Noise pollution is another example. A nightclub generates profit for its owners and entertainment for its customers, while neighbors\u2014who didn\u2019t vote for any of it\u2014lie awake at 3 AM, robbed of sleep and peace of mind. Worse still, as they stare at the ceiling, they can\u2019t help but picture the club owner raising a glass to a successful night.</p> <p>Outbound sales creates similar negative externalities, ones I\u2019ve always found hard to ignore when building sales operations. The pollution isn\u2019t audible like noise or visible like waste, but it\u2019s just as real. It appears as overflowing inboxes, interrupted conversations, and minutes stolen from our concentration. Individually, these costs seem trivial. But multiplied millions of times, they become a burden carried by society\u2014imposed without consent or consultation, like those neighbors kept up by the nightclub.</p> <p>Companies evaluate outbound programs using familiar metrics: the volume of outreach (emails, calls), conversion rates into qualified leads, and the percentage of those leads that become paying customers. Success is declared when the total value of closed deals exceeds the cost of running the program.</p> <p>Those costs are typically calculated as the sum of data acquisition and validation, sales tooling (CRM, sequencing software, automation), outreach efforts (calls, emails, meetings), sales team compensation, marketing collateral, and, to a lesser extent, overhead like compliance and operations.</p> <p>What\u2019s never tallied in this equation are the costs outbound pushes onto everyone else. But if they were factored in\u2014using the same cold numerical logic we apply to leads, deals, and returns\u2014outbound might be designed very differently.</p> <p>There\u2019s another dynamic at play in cold outbound, one that mirrors a well-known dilemma from environmental science.</p> <p>The tragedy of the commons, a concept popularized by ecologist Garrett Hardin in the 1960s, describes how shared resources tend to be overused when individuals act in their own immediate self-interest. In Hardin\u2019s example, several shepherds graze animals on a common pasture; each benefits by adding more livestock, but the damage from overgrazing is shared by all. Eventually, the resource collapses\u2014and everyone loses.</p> <p>Sales faces a similar dynamic. The common pasture is customer attention. These are people who might genuinely benefit from our product, if we could just hold their interest for a few minutes. But that same customer lives in a swarm of competing offers, each salesperson acting rationally by sending one more email, making one more call, leaving one more message.</p> <p>The result: an ecosystem choking on excess. Attention\u2014once relatively abundant\u2014has become scarce, expensive, and increasingly immune to capture, another casualty of a system that generates value by offloading its costs on time, focus, and consent at massive scale.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.</p> <p>The assumption that waste is an unavoidable byproduct of sales isn\u2019t a law of nature. It\u2019s a consequence of how we choose to operate: how we build teams, run programs, and measure success.</p> <p>So: is it possible to build a truly Clean Outbound?</p> <p>That\u2019s the question I explore on these pages: whether outbound programs can be reimagined to drastically reduce the negative externalities we\u2019ve come to accept as normal\u2014and, just as critically, whether they can match or even outperform the effectiveness of the conventional, \u201cdirty\u201d systems that dominate today.</p> <p>Because unless it delivers real results, Clean Outbound is just another elegant theory collecting dust.</p>","tags":["sales","ethics","outbound","externalities","attention","systems"]},{"location":"posts/parasitic-sales/","title":"Parasitic Sales","text":"<p>How companies hijack your instincts to keep you on the line</p> <p>Published: August 11, 2025</p> <p>A visitor in the nest</p> <p>The cuckoo watches from a hidden perch, waiting for the warbler to leave its nest. As soon as the coast is clear, she flies in, lays her egg in seconds, and takes off, often carrying away one of the originals to keep the number the same.</p> <p>Soon after, the warbler returns. Inside are eggs that look exactly like hers. She settles in, warming them without the slightest suspicion.</p> <p>The match is so close the warbler does not notice the intrusion. That cuckoo egg hatches earlier than the rest, revealing a chick already larger and stronger. Within days, it pushes the other eggs, her own offspring, out of the nest entirely.</p> <p>She continues to feed it because the cuckoo chick has evolved to trigger her parental instincts with ruthless precision. The colour of its gape, the pitch of its begging call, and the timing of its hunger are tuned to match or outcompete her own young. Evolutionary biologists call this brood parasitism, the exploitation of one species\u2019 instincts by another.</p>      The cuckoo in the nest \u2014 nature\u2019s original cold caller.    <p>Richard Dawkins, in The Selfish Gene, uses the cuckoo as a vivid example of how natural selection favours strategies that exploit pre-wired behaviours. What\u2019s striking is not that the warbler loses, but that it loses by doing exactly what it has evolved to do. The cuckoo does not need speed or force. It wins by presenting the right signals in the right sequence and letting instinct carry out the rest.</p> <p>The deception works because it targets instincts that cannot be switched off. Even when the truth is obvious, the impulse to feed still wins \u2014 much like picking up the phone out of habit when an unfamiliar number flashes on the screen.</p> <p>Our own wiring</p> <p>We like to think of ourselves as different from the warbler. After all, we\u2019ve got consciousness, reasoning, choice. Surely that protects us from being manipulated by a beak and some chirping.</p> <p>But we also run on instincts \u2014 survival mechanisms shaped over hundreds of thousands of years in an environment where living in a group was the difference between life and death. Politeness, reciprocity, and conflict avoidance weren\u2019t \u201cnice-to-haves.\u201d They were survival code. In small, tightly knit groups, returning a favour kept you in good standing. Avoiding unnecessary conflict meant fewer injuries and stronger cooperation when hunting or defending the group. Responding when addressed signalled awareness and respect, reinforcing bonds that might one day save your life.</p> <p>Over many generations, these behaviours became second nature, reinforced by the survival advantages they brought in the ancestral environment. Those same reflexes now operate in a world of call queues, unknown numbers, and scripted pitches. And like the warbler\u2019s feeding reflex, they can be triggered by the right cues, whether or not the source is genuine.</p> <p>The phone rings</p> <p>Your phone rings. The number\u2019s unfamiliar.</p> <p>You could ignore it, but curiosity, another ancient instinct, taps you on the shoulder. You pick up. The voice on the other end is warm, confident, friendly. They use your name. They ask how you are, and you answer automatically, even though you\u2019ve never met. Only a few seconds in do you realise this is the electricity company, the one that calls every few months with a \u201cspecial rate\u201d that somehow always turns out higher than the one you have now.</p> <p>There\u2019s a shift: part irritation, part guilt. You want to hang up. You also don\u2019t want to be rude. It\u2019s a small but effective trap. You know you don\u2019t want what they\u2019re offering \u2014 yet the polite thing to do, the instinctive thing, is to hear them out.</p> <p>A fine-tuned system</p> <p>The only thing that matters to the people running it is conversion. And conversion goes up when you stay on the line. Whether it\u2019s because the person in charge of outbound is consciously borrowing from the cunning of the cuckoo, or simply the cumulative result of decades of trial and error in call centres (just like biological evolution), we\u2019ve ended up with a system that essentially hijacks your social instincts.</p> <p>The friendly opening. The first-name greeting. The pace and tone of the voice. Each detail tested, refined, and sharpened until it tugs at your wiring just enough to keep you from hanging up.</p> <p>What I find most irritating is that the people who sign off on these tactics will never face you. They don\u2019t hear the sigh in your voice or feel the tension of staying polite while someone burns your time. That part is outsourced to the people on the phones, often underpaid, under pressure, and not to blame for the strategy they\u2019re carrying out.</p> <p>Your frustration has nowhere to go. You hang up, but the system remains untouched. And each call makes you fractionally quicker to cut the next one short.</p> <p>The numbers</p> <p>In Q1 2025, consumers in North America and Europe were hit with 12.5 billion spam and fraud calls; about 137 million a day. Spam now makes up 44 % of unidentified calls in France, 42 % in Spain, and 22 % in the U.S. (Hiya, Q1 2025; Q3 2023).</p> <p>So it\u2019s no surprise that 94 % of European consumers believe unidentified calls are likely spam or fraudulent (Hiya/GSMA, 2022). The share of adults who usually answer unknown numbers has collapsed over the last decade \u2014 to 19 % in the U.S. (Pew, 2020) and 28 % in the UK (YouGov, 2022) \u2014 and the real surprise is that those figures aren\u2019t even lower.</p> <p>Each unwanted call trains us to be quicker to hang up\u2014or never pick up\u2014on the next one. The damage compounds, and over time answer rates fall and conversion follows. No amount of brand spend buys that back. The irony is that companies can spend millions polishing their brand and, in the same quarter, grind it down with tactics that make people less likely to ever pick up again.</p> <p>Just hang up the phone</p> <p>If a reed warbler could suddenly understand the cuckoo\u2019s trick, it wouldn\u2019t hesitate. It would shove the cuckoo chick over the edge the moment it recognised the threat.</p> <p>The chick itself isn\u2019t the villain, but it\u2019s still part of a parasitic system. Same with the voice on the line: they\u2019re just the visible part of a machine built to drain your time for someone else\u2019s gain.</p> <p>Once you spot the pattern, hanging up is not only perfectly reasonable \u2014 it\u2019s an act of self-protection. Your attention and goodwill are finite, and the system is designed to spend them. You\u2019re under no obligation to feed it.</p>","tags":["ethics","sales","outreach","behavioural-science"]},{"location":"posts/praxos-vs-cleanthes/","title":"Praxos vs. Cleanthes","text":"<p>Six strong arguments for conventional outbound, and the case for a cleaner alternative.</p> <p>Published: September 6, 2025</p> <p>Steam hissed from the espresso machine, a counterpoint to the clink of ceramic. Praxos slid into the booth with the unhurried haste of a man who lives on calendars and quota math. Cleanthes was already there, hands around his cup as if coaxing a confession from it. The small talk, if there had been any, was already exhausted.</p> <p>PRAXOS: You have the luxury of paragraphs. I live in dashboards. Outbound works because it\u2019s a controllable input. I turn a dial, meetings appear. It isn't pretty, and Lord knows people hate it, but my board doesn't fund pretty. They fund a healthy, predictable pipeline.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: Pipeline is oxygen. I\u2019m not here to argue against breathing. I\u2019m here to ask what your lungs are made of. If every breath deposits a little scar tissue, at what point do you stop calling it health?</p> <p>PRAXOS: Spare me the poetry. Let\u2019s speak plainly. Outbound is math. Two SDRs\u2014my kids making the calls\u2014one good list. One hundred touches a day. A handful of meetings, a couple of opportunities, one closed deal. The rest is rounding error.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: What's in the \u201crounding error\u201d column, Praxos? Wasted focus. The friction you pushed onto strangers. The filters you helped train to ignore you. The future buyers who now associate your brand with interruption. You keep the revenue on your P&amp;L and push the cost onto the market's balance sheet. A debt like that always comes due.</p> <p>PRAXOS: So you frame it as a moral question. Fine. I\u2019m not allergic to morality, but I am responsible for keeping the lights on. Let's get serious. I'll give you the strongest case for conventional outbound. You try to break it.</p> \"I swear, this toga turns every revenue call into Thermopylae\" <p>ARGUMENT #1: IF WE DON\u2019T OUTBOUND, WE DIE</p> <p>Praxos leaned forward, the energy in the booth shifting from debate to deposition.</p> <p>PRAXOS: One: We are small. We have no gravity. Without a brand, without content, without events, we have two levers that move without asking permission: knock on doors and shout into inboxes. We pull those levers, or we die. Don't tell me to wait for word of mouth. Payroll is on Friday.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: When the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail you have to hit a hundred times. I remember the panic of that payroll. The mistake is to let panic write your strategy. You're right, you have to create motion. But spray and pray creates heat, not light. Precision creates a light that compounds.</p> <p>PRAXOS: Heat is a signal. Heat is meetings. Heat is a pulse. You talk about \u2018light\u2019 as if it\u2019s some immaculate thing we can discover through quiet contemplation. A startup can\u2019t afford analysis paralysis disguised as \u2018precision.\u2019 We find the light by creating heat. We make a hundred calls to learn what the ten best calls would have been. There is no other way.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: I\u2019m not arguing for contemplation. I\u2019m arguing for leverage. A good general doesn't send his entire army to probe the enemy's line. He sends scouts, gathers intelligence, and then concentrates his force where the wall is weakest. That is not paralysis; it is strategy.</p> <p>PRAXOS: Sometimes you don\u2019t know where the wall is weakest until you\u2019ve touched all of it. Volume is how you discover the map.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: Then let\u2019s discover on purpose. Small, capped sampling passes to learn, freeze to think, and only then concentrate fire where the veins are live. Use volume for discovery, but focus for yield.</p> <p>ARGUMENT #2: IF THEY KNEW WE EXISTED, THEY\u2019D WANT US TO EMAIL THEM</p> <p>PRAXOS: Your entire model is based on a flawed premise: that we need to discover where the value is. It\u2019s a luxury of the uncertain. We already know the value. We know the pain is real. The only variable we need to solve for is reach, and that brings me to the foundation of my second point: we are not selling snake oil. We fix a real, painful problem. The introduction is cold because the world is noisy, not because our intent is malicious. If they knew what we do, they'd thank us for the interruption.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: Good intent doesn't absolve you of the cost of your delivery. It's the difference between a tap on the shoulder and tapping everyone in the room because one of them might have a headache.</p> <p>PRAXOS: Your analogy is flawed. This isn't a quiet room; it's a storm. A battlefield. A tap on the shoulder is silence. It gets lost. You need a signal flare to be seen through the chaos. The minor annoyance of that flare is a tiny price to pay for the person who is truly lost and needs rescue. We are selling rescue.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: Then the goal isn't to be a louder flare, Praxos. It\u2019s to be a smarter one. The world is awash in noise. The only way to cut through it is not with volume, but with relevance. That's the different frequency. You make the flare itself a gift of value\u2014an insight, a piece of data, a benchmark they actually don\u2019t have\u2014so that even those who don't need rescuing are glad they looked up. That is how you earn the right to send the next one.</p> <p>ARGUMENT #3: MY REPS HAVE MORTGAGES (SO DO I)</p> <p>PRAXOS: Gifts of value\u2026 you make it sound like we\u2019re a think tank. We are a sales floor. We try. We add insights. You know what happens. Silence. Unsubscribes. And then the meetings. Not many, but enough. The board doesn't applaud our ethics. They applaud our bookings. Which brings me to my third point.</p> <p>Praxos\u2019 voice dropped, the bravado replaced by a raw, immediate pressure.</p> <p>PRAXOS: My reps have mortgages. So do I. I need a plan that closes a gap now.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: And I respect that pressure. More than you know. I've been the one staring at that calendar... But the desperate sprint to solve for now is precisely why you're always in this crisis. It\u2019s a treadmill. You\u2019re burning all your energy just to stay in the same panicked place, quarter after quarter. The speed you feel is an illusion, paid for by making next quarter harder. The only way to close the gap sustainably is to stop digging the hole deeper.</p> <p>PRAXOS: You're talking about next quarter. My CRO asks me, \u2018How many meetings did your team book this week?\u2019 Your philosophy is a fine retirement plan, but I\u2019m fighting a war this quarter. Brand equity and trust don\u2019t show up on a weekly dashboard. I can\u2019t report vibes on Tuesday.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: Then don\u2019t report vibes. Report efficiency. For every thousand doors you knock on, how many real conversations do you start? Not just meetings, but actual positive replies. And track the opposite. How many people slam the door in your face\u2014the unsubscribes, the spam reports? That\u2019s not a vibe, Praxos. That's your supply line. It is the earliest possible signal of the health of the ground you're drilling in.</p> <p>PRAXOS: That sounds slow. All that upfront research, building new rails for tracking... what if the \u201cperfect well\u201d is dry? And how does that help my rep who is at 20% of their monthly quota on the fifteenth?</p> <p>CLEANTHES: You don't turn off the old engine before the new one is running. You dedicate a small, protected fraction of your effort to being geologists. Not for a whole quarter, but for a single, focused sprint. The goal in that sprint isn't to close deals; it's to build a better map. To conduct a short survey of the terrain and find the richest ground. If you don't find a stronger signal with less resistance, you stop. The experiment is small, the risk contained.</p> <p>ARGUMENT #4: I CAN\u2019T PLAY CLEAN IF THE GAME IS RIGGED</p> <p>PRAXOS: A bet. That\u2019s what it is. And it ignores the game-theory angle. My competitors are fighting a knife fight. If I play clean while they all defect, I'm the sucker who loses. My primary duty is to help my team win. To tell my soldiers to bring a polite letter to a knife fight is professional malpractice.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: You're right. In a knife fight, bringing a letter gets you killed. But you're looking at the wrong fight. You're so focused on the man with the knife in front of you that you haven't noticed the arena's walls are closing in on you both. The spam filters, the call screeners... the buyer's cynicism: that is the real opponent. Your competitor's knife can't touch it. But every time he swings wildly, he makes that wall move a little faster for everyone, including you.</p> <p>ARGUMENT #5: OUTBOUND KEEPS THE ECONOMY MOVING</p> <p>PRAXOS: Even that frame is too small. We're talking about tactics. Let's talk about GDP. Let's talk about jobs. What do you think we do? We move value from where it is created to where it is needed. That is the foundational act of any economy. Without a proactive sales motion, great products die on the vine. Companies stagnate. Hiring freezes. Every annoying email is a tiny, fractional cost of that gigantic value creation. It is the cost of doing business. Not my business. All business.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: I would never argue against connecting solutions to problems. The question isn't whether we should connect, but how. You\u2019re defending the efficiency of the engine by ignoring the cost of the fuel. What is the cost in broken trust? In the cynicism that now blankets the entire profession? An economic system that runs on burning trust is, by definition, unsustainable.</p> <p>ARGUMENT #6: THE MARKET LEARNS BECAUSE WE POKE IT</p> <p>PRAXOS: Unsustainable? It's the only thing that creates what's next. A sustainable, 'clean' system is a closed loop. My final point is this: true innovation doesn't ask for permission. The market learns because we poke it. Our job is to solve problems people don't even have the language for yet. That requires interruption. You're arguing for a cleaner river. I'm arguing that the river's current is what powers the whole damn city.</p> <p>Cleanthes nods slowly.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: That is the most honest defense I have ever heard. And you are right: progress doesn't ask for permission. But you're confusing the act of exploration with the method of clear-cutting. History has two explorers: the wildcatter who drills a hundred holes hoping to get lucky, and the geologist who studies the terrain to know where to drill one. Both are proactive. But only the geologist's model compounds. The wildcatter's depletes. That's the difference. Clean isn't about waiting for permission. It\u2019s about earning the right to interrupt through the sheer quality of your hypothesis.</p> <p>Spare me the philosophy: what does my BDR do at 9 a.m.?</p> <p>Praxos stared into his empty cup for a long moment, turning it slowly on the saucer. The aggressive certainty had finally settled, leaving a quieter, more pragmatic weight in its place.</p> <p>PRAXOS: A geologist, huh? ...You're still smuggling aesthetics in as ethics. But you've at least grounded it in a logic of efficiency. So let\u2019s be specific: What happens when the geologist's map is wrong? When the single, perfect well comes up dry and the calendar is empty on the fifteenth of the month?</p> <p>CLEANTHES: Then you have a reserve of higher-friction plays you use like an emergency flare, not like your daily strategy. You run them with integrity, you learn from it, and you improve the map. This isn't about purity. It's about stewardship.</p> <p>PRAXOS: You gave me an ethos. I asked for a checklist.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: The checklist is the shadow of the ethos. I'll bring you both. We'll build it so your team can run it without guesswork. If it doesn\u2019t move your numbers, throw it out.</p> <p>PRAXOS: Bring me the checklist. And the dashboard that proves your signals are improving while the calendar fills. The numbers will make it culture.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: Deal.</p> <p>The barista called out an order. The steam wand hissed once more, steady and indifferent.</p>","tags":["outbound","clean-sales","ethics","debate"]},{"location":"posts/the-day-of-the-blast/","title":"The Day of the Blast","text":"<p>How the first mass email created outbound\u2019s original sin</p> <p>Published: September 4, 2025</p> <p>I. The Mill in Maynard</p> <p>The birthplace of spam smelled faintly of wet wool.</p> <p>Digital Equipment Corporation, DEC to insiders, ran its empire from an old mill in Maynard, Massachusetts. Brick walls, long windows, the river just outside. Where spindles once clattered, engineers now argued about logic circuits.</p> <p>DEC was founded in 1957 by two engineers with sharply different temperaments. Ken Olsen was brilliant, stubborn, and famously confident in his forecasts \u2014 including one pronouncement that would come back to haunt him\u00b9. Harlan Anderson, more pragmatic, clashed with Olsen often enough that he left the company in the early 1960s. Together, they transformed a wool mill into the launchpad of the minicomputer revolution.</p> Ken Olsen, DEC's visionary founder, exept when it came to home computers. <p>Their weapon was the PDP line, which shrank the hulking IBM mainframe into something that could sit in a university lab, humming away under fluorescent lights. The PDP-8 in 1965 broke the $20,000 barrier; the PDP-11 went on to train a generation of programmers.</p> <p>By the late 1970s, DEC was the world\u2019s number two computer maker. IBM still wore the suit and tie; DEC showed up in corduroys and a coffee stain. One preached centralization. The other whispered: give the smart people their own machines and see what happens.</p> <p>\u00b9Olsen in 1977: \u201cThere is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.\u201d</p> <p>II. The Next Big Thing</p> <p>But markets move. IBM wasn\u2019t going away, Hewlett-Packard was closing in, and the personal computer loomed like a storm cloud on the horizon. DEC needed another hit.</p> <p>Enter the VAX \u2014 the Virtual Address eXtension line, launched in 1977. These were muscular minicomputers, designed for real workloads.</p> <p>DEC had the machine. What it needed was the stage. And in 1978, the stage was a fledgling network called ARPANET.</p> <p>III. The Network of the Chosen Few</p> <p>In 1969, the U.S. Department of Defense funded a bold experiment: connect research computers across the country so information could move even if parts of the system went down. Four machines went online first: UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah. Resilience was the goal, survival through outages or attacks.</p> <p>What began as a defense project quickly turned academic. By the early \u201970s, ARPANET hosted email, file transfers, even the first awkward stabs at online chat. Membership was tightly controlled: government agencies, universities, research labs. Having an ARPANET account meant you were inside a small, privileged circle trusted by the Pentagon.</p> ARPANET in its formative years: a sparse, elite graph of trust. <p>By 1978, that circle had grown to a few hundred nodes. The users were scientists, grad students, systems managers, defense contractors... the very people who decided which machines their institutions would buy. Logging on conferred status: technically fluent, institutionally powerful, and, coincidentally, DEC\u2019s perfect customer profile.</p> <p>The network wasn\u2019t a marketplace. It was a curated guest list. For a marketer like Gary Thuerk, it looked like destiny.</p> <p>IV. The Father of Spam</p> <p>Gary Thuerk wasn\u2019t an engineer. He studied business at the University of Massachusetts and joined DEC through the marketing track. His job was to move machines, not design them: booking demo halls, organizing roadshows, finding the people who could sign purchase orders.</p> <p>By the mid-1970s he was a young manager in DEC\u2019s Marlboro office, ambitious and audacious. Engineers at DEC often treated marketing as ornamental, but Thuerk believed in the leverage of getting the message right. He wanted to prove that marketing could matter as much as circuitry.</p> <p>By spring 1978, he spotted an opening. ARPANET wasn\u2019t just a research tool; it was a ready-made address book of the very people who decided which minicomputers to buy. One list, hundreds of decision-makers. For Thuerk, it looked less like a network experiment and more like the most efficient invite list he\u2019d ever seen.</p> <p>V. The Day of the Blast</p> <p>On May 3, 1978, Thuerk pulled the trigger. DEC was hosting two events in San Francisco and Los Angeles to unveil the DECSYSTEM-20, a time-sharing descendant of the PDP-10. Instead of dialing phones or licking envelopes, he drafted a single ARPANET message.</p> <p>\u201cWe invite you to a presentation of the new DECsystem-20 family of systems, the most powerful interactive minicomputers in the world\u2026\u201d</p> <p>The invitation went out to 393 recipients. ARPANET\u2019s mail program, never designed for mass lists, buckled under the load. Addresses spilled into the body of the message, creating a messy block of exposed hostnames; a digital equivalent of printing the guest list on the front of the envelope.</p> <p>Embarrassing? Yes. Disqualifying? No. The important part had already happened: the blast had cleared the machine and landed in hundreds of inboxes.</p> <p>VI. Pandemonium</p> <p>The response was swift \u2014 and hostile. ARPANET was funded by the Department of Defense and reserved for research and collaboration. Commercial use broke a shared norm.</p> <p>Administrators erupted. Memos flew. One captured the mood:</p> <p>\u201cThis was a flagrant violation of the ARPANET\u2026 advertising of particular products should be strongly discouraged.\u201d</p> <p>Thuerk\u2019s colleagues bristled as well. In a company where engineering ruled and marketing survived on sufferance, he had committed a cultural felony.</p> <p>His bosses at DEC scolded him. But they didn\u2019t fire him.</p> <p>And that detail is the key. From the very beginning, spam was condemned in public and rewarded in private. Thuerk himself later claimed the blast generated $10\u201314 million in sales. For a single email, that\u2019s a staggering return. Outrage on the surface, results underneath. That dynamic has shaped the industry ever since.</p> <p>VII. The Paradox of the First Spam</p> <p>Forget the caricature of the clueless spammer. Gary Thuerk was a sharpshooter. The product was real. The audience was perfect. The event mattered. And the numbers proved it: millions in revenue flowed from that single unsolicited send.</p> <p>He got the \u201cwho\u201d and the \u201cwhat\u201d exactly right. He just got the \u201cwhere\u201d catastrophically wrong.</p> <p>ARPANET was a members-only club built on trust, not a marketplace open to bids. It was a space for collaboration, and his message was a commercial intrusion. Consent wasn\u2019t just missing; the very idea of it was alien to the network\u2019s culture.</p> <p>This is why the first spam is spam. It\u2019s the original sin of confusing audience with permission. The content was relevant, but the context was violated.</p> Gary Thuerk, the father of spa... e-marketing. <p>VIII. The Legacy</p> <p>History has been less kind than the balance sheet. Gary Thuerk is remembered as the \u201cFather of Spam,\u201d a title he resents.

But the gospel that promised predictability never prepared us for what  happened when the market stopped caring about what the factory produced. </p> <p>I. The World Before the Cloud</p> <p>Before Salesforce, enterprise software was a kingdom ruled by entrenched behemoths like  Oracle and Siebel. Oracle alone pulled in more than $10 billion in annual revenue and  employed over 40,000 people by 2000. Siebel, the CRM king of its era, boasted 8,000  employees and nearly $2 billion in revenue. It was a world of on-premise software, delivered  on CDs and installed on hulking racks of servers that lived in freezing corporate basements.  The price tags were astronomical, often running into the millions, and that was just the  beginning. </p> <p>Buying a CRM from Siebel wasn't like buying a product; it was like commissioning a  cathedral. The process took months, sometimes years. And once the deal was finally signed,  the real pain began. An army of consultants would descend upon your company for the  better part of a year, billing by the hour to customize and implement the behemoth. A year  later, when an upgrade was released, you\u2019d often have to repeat the entire agonizing  process. </p> <p>This was the world Marc Benioff, a former Oracle executive with a showman\u2019s flair, decided  to burn down. His new model, \u201cSoftware as a Service,\u201d was a direct assault on the old order. </p> <p>At Salesforce\u2019s 2000 launch, Benioff wrapped the idea in spectacle. The company staged its  \u201cEnd of Software\u201d campaign with hired actors protesting outside Siebel\u2019s user conference  at Moscone Center. They waved NO SOFTWARE placards and chanted, \u201cThe Internet is  really neat\u2026 software is obsolete!\u201d as Benioff recalled in his book Behind the Cloud. It was  theater meant to show SaaS as a ruthless regime change. </p> <p>Instead of million-dollar upfront fees, it offered a flexible per-seat subscription. Instead of  year-long implementations, you could be up and running in a week. Upgrades, once a  dreaded ritual, now happened automatically, in the background, for free. By the mid-2000s,  Salesforce had redefined how software was built, sold, and used. </p> Salesforce actors, delivering SaaS with maximum cringe. <p>But this new model ran headfirst into a very old problem. The prevailing wisdom for how to  actually sell the stuff was a relic from the age of Siebel. </p> <p>II. The Age of the Artist</p> <p>Before the machine, there was the artist. </p> <p>He was a rare operator, the top enterprise seller of the pre-SaaS era. We\u2019ll call him The  Natural. You know the type, even if you\u2019ve only seen him in movies, or Netflix. The  charismatic lone wolf who operates on instinct and relationships. His tradecraft lived in a  black box: intuition, long lunches, steak dinners. His forecast was a gut feeling. His CRM  was a leather-bound notebook filled with inscrutable scribbles about a client\u2019s daughter\u2019s  graduation. He was magic. He was art. </p> <p>The Natural was perfectly adapted to the world of multi-million-dollar, on-premise deals.  Those deals were marathons: long sales cycles, CIO politics, and relationships cultivated  over years. SaaS as a business model broke that pattern. Contracts were smaller, renewals  more frequent, and growth depended less on a few heroic closers than on a system that  could generate wins week after week. The Natural\u2019s style simply didn\u2019t scale to that world. </p> \u201cGuess what Salesforce\u2019s recruiter said?\u201d <p>III. The Systems Thinker</p> <p>Aaron Ross stepped on the stage in 2002. Trained as an engineer, he had passed through  venture capital, then burned through his own startup as CEO. He wasn\u2019t a natural seller. But  at Salesforce in 2002, he arrived with his own ideas for how to turn prospecting into a  process. </p> <p>The need was urgent. Salesforce\u2019s sales team was drowning in leads, but not in a good way.  Account Executives were doing everything at once: cold outreach, qualification, demos, and  closing. That worked at a tiny scale, but it broke under the sheer volume of leads Salesforce  was starting to generate. In 2002, the year Ross joined, Salesforce booked $22 million in  revenue, up from just $5 million the year before, and the pace was only accelerating. Too  much time vanished chasing unqualified prospects. Deals stalled, pipeline felt unpredictable,  and growth risked bottlenecking on the bandwidth of a few overstretched AEs. </p> <p>What Ross built would later be mythologized as Cold Calling 2.0: an outbound system that  split the sales force into hunters and closers, mechanized pipeline generation, and treated  sales less as art and more as industrial process. A new role, the Sales Development Rep  (SDR), was responsible for one thing only: prospecting and qualifying leads. The qualified  leads went to Account Executives (AEs), the closers who could now focus exclusively on  winning deals. It was a factory line applied to the sales pipeline. </p> <p>The results were undeniable. Within a few years, Ross\u2019s playbook added an extra $100  million in Annual Run Rate. But the real explosion came later, when he left Salesforce,  distilled his learnings into a self-published book in 2011, and gave it a name destined to  become startup scripture: Predictable Revenue. </p> <p>IV. The Gospel Spreads</p> <p>The book landed at exactly the right moment. The SaaS boom was in full swing, and  investors were suddenly obsessed with building repeatable, scalable revenue machines.  Almost overnight, Predictable Revenue became canon. </p> <p>Its magic trick was turning the abstract art of sales into a concrete, measurable  waterfall\u2014the sales funnel. You could now say, with data to back it up: \u201cFor every 100  prospects our SDRs contact, we get 3 meetings. For every 3 meetings our AEs take, we  close 1 deal.\u201d Growth was no longer a mystery. It made growth legible. </p> <p>Founders bought boxes of the book for their sales teams. VCs handed it to their portfolio  CEOs as required reading. Jason Lemkin called it the \u201cSales Bible of Silicon Valley.\u201d The  adoption was staggering. According to surveys by firms like The Bridge Group, by 2015  nearly 70% of high-growth tech companies had adopted the specialized SDR/AE model.  Copying the model felt like de-risking. This new assembly-line approach was becoming the  industry standard. </p> <p>V. The Prophet's Regret</p> <p>But like any gospel, its truth was bent in the retelling. What Ross had pioneered as a smart,  surgical outbound motion began to morph into the flood of cold outreach that would drown  buyers\u2019 inboxes. The average B2B decision-maker, who received perhaps a handful of  prospecting emails a week in the early 2000s, now faces a daily barrage. Recent studies  show reply rates for cold outreach in B2B have slipped into the 1-2% range. If you\u2019ve ever  groaned at yet another bland, semi-personalized outbound message, you\u2019ve lived inside  Ross\u2019s unintended legacy. </p> <p>Ross himself became a kind of reluctant prophet. His follow-up book, 2016\u2019s From  Impossible to Inevitable, can be read as one giant correction to the sins being committed in  his name. The industry had become obsessed with the tactics in his first book while  completely ignoring the foundational strategy. The new book was a massive  course-correction. Its central theme was \u201cNail a Niche,\u201d a plea to focus on a tiny market. It  was a clear warning that said, \u201cYou are all doing it wrong.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s striking to revisit the way Predictable Revenue was originally pitched. The back cover  promised \u201czero cold calls,\u201d described lead generation through \u201cmarketing by teaching,\u201d and  called it \u201ca new kind of sales system.\u201d Ross\u2019s intent was never to flood inboxes with  automation. The gospel was framed as clean, disciplined, even educational. </p> <p>But the market heard something different. \u201cPredictable\u201d became shorthand for volume math,  not strategy. The tactics scaled. The intent was forgotten.  </p> <p>VI. The Legacy of the Machine</p> <p>Predictable Revenue didn\u2019t just shape how companies built go-to-market engines, it also  rewired venture capital\u2019s pattern recognition. For years, partner memos and boardroom  questions centered less on \u201cIs your product great?\u201d and more on \u201cHave you built the  machine?\u201d The presence of a functioning predictable revenue engine became the litmus test  for a Series A investment\u2014a signal that the company was ready to receive capital and pour  it into the top of the funnel. </p> <p>In retrospect, Predictable Revenue belongs to the canon of startup scripture alongside The  Lean Startup and Crossing the Chasm. It offered what founders and VCs crave most: a story  of control over chaos. In a world where revenue had always felt like a black box, Ross  promised a factory blueprint. </p> <p>Two decades later, SaaS founders still talk about \u201cbuilding a predictable revenue engine.\u201d  The book became bigger than its author, and the framework became bigger than the  company it was born in. Salesforce got its $100M boost. Ross got his legacy. And VCs got a  playbook they could bet billions on. </p> <p>The gospel gave sales its factory. But the very efficiency of that model produced buyer fatigue, channel saturation, and a creeping distrust of outreach itself. The age of predictable volume is over. The next one will have to be built on something else entirely.</p> <p>The blueprint of scale taught us how to grow, not what to do when the market stopped caring about what the machine produced.</p>","tags":["sales","history","predictable-revenue","outbound","ethics"]},{"location":"posts/the-red-queen/","title":"The Red Queen","text":"<p>A 40-Year History of the Spam Arms Race</p> <p>Published: September 5, 2025</p> <p>I. The Cliffs</p> <p>Stand on the Dover coast on a bright day and the White Cliffs glare back, improbably stark against the sea. They\u2019re made almost entirely of ancient plankton shells, billions upon billions of microscopic skeletons pressed into chalk over tens of millions of years.</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to treat them as geology, nothing more. But they are also the fossilized memory of an arms race.</p> <p>Two hundred and fifty million years ago, after the Permian extinction, mollusks were soft targets. Their shells were paper-thin, half a millimeter at most. Early crabs and shell-crushing fish cracked them like peanuts.</p> <p>Then came escalation. By the Jurassic, shells had doubled and tripled in thickness. By the Cretaceous, they sprouted spikes and ridges. Crabs answered with claws three times stronger than their ancestors\u2019. Fossils preserve the scars: failed bites, drill holes, fractured shells.</p> <p>Predator, prey, predator, prey. Faster, thicker, sharper, stronger. Everyone running just to stand still.</p> <p>Layer this over millions of years and you end up with cliffs tall enough to guide ships. Evolution leaves monuments \u2014 a sedimentary ledger of pressure and response.</p> <p>II. The Red Queen</p> <p>This treadmill is what biologist Leigh Van Valen named the Red Queen effect, after Lewis Carroll\u2019s queen who tells Alice:</p> <p>\u201cNow, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\u201d</p> <p>Van Valen argued that species aren\u2019t just adapting to their environments. They\u2019re adapting to each other\u2019s adaptations, a coevolutionary arms race. \u201cContinuing development,\u201d he wrote in 1973, \u201cis needed just in order to maintain fitness relative to the systems it is co-evolving with.\u201d</p> <p>Carroll himself admired the Dover cliffs on his Channel crossings. He could never have guessed his whimsical queen would end up as one of biology\u2019s most durable metaphors. But here we are.</p> <p>III. The First Bite</p> <p>Fast forward to May 3, 1978.</p> <p>Gary Thuerk, a marketer at Digital Equipment Corporation, decided to announce a product demo. He did it by sending a single message to every ARPANET address he could find on the West Coast\u2014nearly four hundred of them. The network\u2019s mail protocol, never designed for such a blast, promptly choked. The recipient list was so long it overflowed the header and spilled down into the body of the message itself, a clumsy, unavoidable catalog of every person who had just been spammed.</p> <p>In that tight-knit digital ecosystem, the message landed like a bite on unarmored flesh.</p> <p>This was the opening move in a new kind of arms race. The arena had changed from the tidal pool to the inbox, but the Red Queen\u2019s logic was identical: an escalating contest between attack and defense, fought between those seeking attention and those trying to avoid distraction.</p> <p>The prey reacted quickly. ARPA administrators condemned the intrusion, angry memos flew, and rules were drafted to forbid commercial use. Outrage hardened into a cultural shell.</p> <p>But the incentives pointed in a different direction: Thuerk\u2019s bosses publicly scolded him, then, privately, kept him on. The blast was credited with more than $10 million in sales. Etiquette could be bruised; revenue could not. The arms race had its fuel. (For the full story of Thuerk\u2019s infamous message, see The Day of the Blast.)</p> <p>IV. The Deluge</p> <p>Once the payoff was visible, escalation was inevitable. Cultural defenses were brittle; infrastructure offered leverage. The richest seam was the \u201copen relay\u201d: a misconfigured mail server willing to forward anything for anyone. It was as if every post office in the world agreed to deliver any sack of letters, free of charge, no questions asked. Overnight, the cost of sending collapsed toward zero and a single stunt became industrial practice.</p> <p>Prey response: the first filters. They were laughably simple, scanning for banned words like \u201cViagra.\u201d For a moment, it worked.</p> <p>Counter-move: \u201cViagra\u201d became \u201cV1agra.\u201d Spammers padded messages with invisible gibberish to dilute the signal and confuse the filters. Each shell provoked a sharper claw.</p> <p>And then the abstract threat acquired a face. In 1994, a husband-and-wife legal team, Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel, posted ads for their immigration law services across thousands of Usenet groups. The pitch was ordinary; the method was not. By blanketing nearly every discussion board, they turned a small ad into a network-wide nuisance. The backlash was instant. Canter and Siegel became the \u201cGreen Card Lawyers,\u201d briefly the most hated people on the internet, and for many this was the moment spam felt less like an annoyance and more like an invasive species.</p> Martha Siegel and Laurence Canter: \"Technically, it was class action.\" <p>V. Laws and Bayes</p> <p>The ecosystem fought back on two fronts: technical and legal.</p> <p>On the technical front, programmer Paul Graham published A Plan for Spam in 2002. Instead of crude keyword lists, he used probability. A \u201cBayesian filter\u201d would look at the words in an email and estimate the odds it was junk. If a message contained \u201cViagra\u201d and \u201cfree,\u201d the math said spam. If it contained \u201cproject\u201d and \u201cdeadline,\u201d the math said ham. Not perfect, but clever \u2014 a truly adaptive shell.</p> <p>Meanwhile, lawmakers tried to legislate the problem away. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 sounded decisive. It wasn\u2019t. The law was a clumsy shell, full of holes.</p> <p>The predators, of course, adapted to both.</p> <p>One counter was \u201crandom word salad.\u201d Spammers stuffed emails with chunks of legitimate text \u2014 stolen from novels, news stories, even other emails \u2014 to push the probabilities back in their favor. Camouflage by ordinary English.</p> <p>When that faltered, they tried another mutation: image-only spam. The message was no longer text at all, but a JPEG of the ad. A human eye could read it instantly. A Bayesian filter, which only looked at words, saw nothing.</p> <p>Every thicker shell met with a sharper claw.</p> <p>VI. Botnets and Blackouts</p> <p>By 2007, spam made up 90% of global email. Not a typo. Ninety percent.</p> <p>Predator move: botnets. Millions of ordinary home computers infected with malware and quietly drafted into a zombie army. Each one looked normal on a desk, but together they became a giant spam factory. The Storm botnet alone may have controlled fifty million machines.</p> <p>Prey response: defenders tried cutting predators off at the source. They built blacklists of known spam servers, unplugged shady internet providers, and coordinated international takedowns.</p> <p>The most dramatic moment came in 2008, when a little-known hosting company in California, McColo, was disconnected from the internet. Security researchers had traced a huge share of global spam traffic back to servers running there. When upstream providers finally pulled the plug, worldwide spam volumes plunged 70% overnight.</p> <p>For a moment it looked like victory.</p> <p>But not for long. The predators rebuilt. Mikko Hypp\u00f6nen of F-Secure summed it up: \u201cEvery time we kill one botnet, another takes its place. It\u2019s like mowing the lawn.\u201d</p> <p>VII. CAPTCHAs and Farms</p> <p>Predator move: after blacklists and ISP takedowns made it risky to run their own servers, spammers pivoted to free webmail. Hotmail, Yahoo, later Gmail \u2014 infinite, disposable sender identities for zero cost, all piggybacking on the good reputation of a mainstream provider. Spin up a thousand accounts, blast, burn them, repeat.</p> <p>Prey response: throttle the factory at the door. Providers put puzzles on the signup page to block automated account creation. CAPTCHAs, those squiggly letters you had to retype, were designed to be trivial for a human eye and maddening for a script. Early bots couldn\u2019t read warped text; the conveyor belt of throwaway accounts slowed.</p> <p>Counter-move: spammers outsourced the eyesight. They tricked users into solving CAPTCHAs (\u201ctype these letters to get your free download\u201d), then built \u201cCAPTCHA farms\u201d where low-wage workers solved puzzles all day, pennies per hundred. Human perception, industrialized.</p> <p>Claw, shell. Shell, claw.</p> <p>VIII. Filters and Sequencers</p> <p>By the 2010s, brute-force volume stopped working. Google boasted its filters caught 99.9% of spam, and for once the claim was close to true. Behind the scenes, billions of signals fed machine-learning systems: sender reputation, domain age, user behavior, even the subtle rhythm of how emails were written and opened. The old flood tactics drowned under the weight of statistical scrutiny.</p> <p>Predators adapted again. They turned to email warming: sending low volumes of harmless messages from a fresh domain to trick filters into assigning a good reputation, then slowly ramping up volume until the account was \u201ctrusted.\u201d Sequencing tools added another layer, staggering sends and varying wording so that no two recipients saw the same pattern.</p> <p>The effect was to look less like a botnet and more like a salesperson, while still being a botnet at scale. The camouflage worked because it hijacked human instincts. A message that appears timely, personal, and written \u201cjust for you\u201d taps the same reflexes we explored in Parasitic Sales: our tendency to trust the polite knock, to grant attention when approached as individuals. Automation had learned to mimic courtesy.</p> <p>IX. AI vs. AI</p> <p>The arms race has now reached language itself. Large models can generate endless variations of \u201cpersonal\u201d outreach; fluent, polished, and tuned to mimic the quirks of human senders. Every email feels one-off, even when it is one of thousands.</p> <p>Defenders answer in kind. Spam filters are themselves powered by models, scanning for patterns invisible to the human eye: statistical oddities in tone, rhythm, or metadata that betray automation hiding behind a friendly greeting.</p> <p>For the first time, the duel is not just automation dressed as humanity, but two intelligences locked against each other; one creating the illusion of human attention, the other trying to pierce it.</p> <p>This strange predator\u2013prey dance around language is only beginning. It deserves its own story, and I will tell it soon.</p> <p>X. The Hidden Cliffs</p> <p>The history of spam is written in residues. Each message stirs a machine to act, each delivery consumes a thread of bandwidth, each deletion takes a fraction of attention. Insignificant on its own, almost invisible.</p> <p>But what is negligible in isolation becomes immense in the mass. Billions of cycles of wasted computation, terabytes of empty traffic sent beneath the seas, uncounted hours of human focus pulled aside.</p> <p>These layers accumulate as surely as shells pressed into chalk. An unseen sediment of inefficiency builds year after year, a cliff face invisible to the eye yet growing all the same.</p> <p>All that running, only to build a monument to standing still.</p>","tags":["history","sales","spam","arms-race","outbound"]}]}
