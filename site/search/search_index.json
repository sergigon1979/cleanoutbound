At its core, it's about helping people discover, understand, and ultimately buy products that deliver real value. Sales acts as a catalyst: it accelerates value reaching the people who need it, shortening the gap between what a product promises and what a customer actually experiences. The world simply cannot function without sales.</p> <p>And yet, sales often ends up dirty, and cold outbound sales particularly so. It creates what economists call a negative externality: a cost imposed on third parties who neither chose nor benefit from the transaction. A chemical plant discharges waste into the river; the cost is borne by communities downstream. A nightclub generates profit for its owners and entertainment for its customers, while neighbors, who didn't vote for any of it, lie awake at 3 AM.</p> <p>Outbound sales works the same way. Overflowing inboxes, interrupted conversations, minutes stolen from concentration. Individually trivial. Multiplied millions of times, a burden carried by society, imposed without consent. Like those neighbors kept up by the nightclub.</p> <p>Outbound programs get the same cost-benefit treatment as everything else. On one side, the costs: data, tools, people, overhead. On the other, the returns: deals closed, revenue generated. Success means the ratio hits some target\u2014usually a multiple of lifetime value over acquisition cost.</p> <p>What's never tallied in that equation: the costs outbound pushes onto everyone else. Factor them in, and outbound can't be run the same way.</p> <p>It doesn't have to be this way. Does it?</p> <p>It does. </p> <p>Granted, outbound can never be truly clean. Not without consent. But most people would agree that some friction, and even cost-shifting, is acceptable in exchange for the broad value commerce creates. What they object to is practices that feel truly extractive, like endless email sequencing or automated follow-ups that run on autopilot for months.</p> <p>Clean outbound is the idea that you don't have to be extractive to be effective. Send less, but send better, and the increase in win rate will compensate for the reduced volume. If most companies don't operate this way, it must be because doing so is difficult. It requires better tools, more research and greater skill, so they're taking an easier path.</p> <p>It doesn't work that way. Better tools don't lead to more discipline. They lead to more volume. You get access to better data and suddenly there are more people worth contacting. You get automated sequences and one person can do what five once did. But you have five. You get AI-written copy and the bottleneck of composition disappears. At each step, you could bank the efficiency. But why would you? More reach is more opportunity. Restraint leaves money on the table.</p> <p>Everyone makes the same choice. Each efficiency gain gets converted into more output. When steam engines became more efficient, coal consumption rose. When email became cheaper to send well, more email got sent.</p> <p>The result is a channel that degrades steadily. When recipients face a hundred emails that look thoughtful, they stop distinguishing. Quality loses its ability to signal quality. Neither the sender who invests in relevance nor the sender who invests in volume can break through. Eventually all messages become indistinguishable, and the channel ceases to work for anyone.</p> <p>Scholars have described and named these dynamics\u2014the Jevons paradox, the tragedy of the commons\u2014but the pattern in outbound sales is simply this: efficiency spurs volume, volume is destroying the shared resource.</p> <p>Individual rationality, collective ruin. Incentives and structure make this outcome feel inevitable.</p> <p>This project explores how we got here: the arms race between senders and filters, the regulatory choices that left email unprotected, the economic logic that made volume the default. And what happens when a channel collapses, taking with it the companies that still rely on it and the founders for whom it was the default path to growth.</p>","tags":["sales","outbound","externalities","incentives","attention"]},{"location":"posts/degrees-of-clean/","title":"Degrees of Clean","text":"<p>Why Clean Sales is a ladder, not a switch \u2014 and how to climb it</p> <p>In Outbound is Dirty, I compared conventional outbound sales to a poorly regulated factory: profitable for the operator, costly for everyone else. The costs take the form of an attention tax, minutes of focus taken from unwilling recipients of poorly targeted emails. These recipients are, in effect, subsidising the sender\u2019s business.</p> <p>I cast the problem as a binary: your outbound is either \u201cdirty\u201d or \u201cclean.\u201d It was a convenient simplification, but reality is less tidy. Cleanliness is not a switch you flip. It is a ladder you climb, one rung or one step at a time. Some systems burn dirtier than others. The intelligent goal is not to reach some mythical top rung of perfect cleanliness, which would perhaps mean no selling at all. The goal is to keep climbing toward cleaner operation.</p> <p>You can see the same pattern in energy generation. At the bottom step: wood fires, leaving soot on walls, clothes, and lungs. We climbed to coal: cleaner and more efficient than wood, but whole cities still wore a permanent gray coat. Then came natural gas: cleaner still, producing more heat per unit and at a lower cost, though still a fossil fuel with significant emissions, methane leakage during extraction, and reliance on finite reserves. Now we climb toward solar. Not perfect; it uses land, requires manufacturing, and recycling panels is a challenge. Yet it is vastly cleaner than anything below it and, in many cases, already cheaper.</p> <p>Moving up the ladder usually means a better balance of cost and cleanliness. Some shifts are obvious. Solar beats coal on both measures. Others are harder to call. Old fuels can linger through habit, inertia, and sunk costs, even when cleaner, cheaper options exist.</p> <p>Sales has its own version of the ladder. The bottom steps are mass-blast, low-precision, low-value tactics. Higher up are systems that aim precisely, deliver genuine value per touch, and know when to stop. They are cleaner and they work better. Yet, as in energy, the lower steps still dominate the grid.</p> <p>Why Bother Climbing</p> <p>One reason to climb is sustainability.</p> <p>Hannah Ritchie, in Not the End of the World, defines it as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. For most of history, we failed at the first part: we could not meet our own needs. Now we can. But we do it by consuming the very systems that future generations will rely on.</p> <p>Sales faces the same structural flaw. A company can meet this quarter\u2019s target through mass outreach, misaligned pitches, and brute-force persistence. The tactic works, but only by degrading the channel itself \u2014 burning trust, lowering response rates, and making the next prospect that much harder to reach. It\u2019s the sales equivalent of strip-mining: the numbers look great today, but you\u2019re standing in a field of churned mud wondering where the next vein is.</p> <p>Ritchie\u2019s argument is that our generation is the first with the means to break this pattern. The parallel in sales is exact. We have the measurement to see the damage, and the tools to reduce it without reducing results. The question is no longer whether it can be done, but whether we choose to keep digging holes or start building something that lasts. (Spoiler alert: AI will help.)</p> <p>Ways of Being Clean</p> <p>Cleanliness isn\u2019t binary, and it isn\u2019t measured in only one way.</p> <p>In energy, cleanliness is measured on several axes: carbon emissions, land use, deaths per terawatt-hour, toxic waste. Each is a separate measure of harm. Progress means reducing the impact on each axis, even if none can be brought to zero.</p> <p>Sales has its own axes of cleanliness. Dirty systems impose the highest attention cost \u2014 consuming large amounts of human focus for little useful return. The goal is to meet sales targets while lowering that cost. Greater precision in targeting. Higher density of value in every contact. Messages that are clear. An approach that is honest and respectful. Improving on these dimensions reduces the cost imposed on the market and makes results more durable.</p> <p>Precision: Aim Before You Fire</p> <p>Dirty sales systems spray attention costs across people who were never going to buy. Precision reduces that waste.</p> <p>I recently spoke with a sales rep selling an outbound tool. He proudly told me it delivered \u201cindustry-beating\u201d reply rates of 5%. For every 5 people who responded, there were 95 who would rather not have received the email at all. That\u2019s considered best in class.</p> <p>The fix isn\u2019t just \u201cbetter lists.\u201d It\u2019s understanding why a prospect might be in-market now. In sales tech, this gets lumped under \u201cintent signals,\u201d but not all intent is equal. True intent is direct evidence of active interest or relevant need: a public statement from the buyer, a job posting that signals a capability gap, a technology change you know creates pain you can solve.</p> <p>What often gets sold as \u201cintent\u201d is far weaker: someone at the company read a vaguely related article, or a contact clicked on a link in a generic newsletter. Those can help with prioritisation, but they\u2019re not reasons to reach out. When your definition of intent is loose, you end up creating noise that drowns out the signal.</p> <p>Precision means reserving the interruption for when you have a specific, time-sensitive reason to believe you can help. Every touch still spends attention, but when you fire only on true intent, the cost is far more likely to generate value \u2014 for you and for the buyer.</p> <p>Value Density: Paying Back Attention</p> <p>Once you\u2019ve aimed correctly, the interaction must be worth the prospect\u2019s time. Value Density is the ratio of insight delivered to attention consumed. In a clean system, that ratio is always in focus.</p> <p>Consider a discovery call. In the low-density version, the seller works through a script. The buyer answers questions, the clock runs out, and they leave knowing nothing new. Thirty minutes gone \u2014 a pure attention tax.</p> <p>In the high-density version, the seller arrives with context. They share observations from similar companies, highlight a risk the buyer hasn\u2019t considered, suggest a quick check the team can run, or link a recent move to a likely consequence. The buyer leaves better informed, whether or not they are a fit.</p> <p>Both calls meet the seller\u2019s need for qualification. Only one repays the attention it costs.</p> <p>Clarity: Don\u2019t Make Them Pay Twice</p> <p>Every message already costs attention. If it\u2019s unclear, you add a second toll, the mental effort to figure out what you meant.</p> <p>That second toll is rarely obvious, but the reader feels it. It\u2019s that moment when they have to stop, re-read, and piece together your point. Even if they get there, you\u2019ve made them work for something they didn\u2019t ask for in the first place.</p> <p>The empathetic move is to carry that burden yourself. Use their vocabulary, put the point first, make the next step obvious.</p> <p>Honesty</p> <p>The fake email thread. Subject line starts with \u201cRE:\u201d to look like you\u2019re replying to something they sent. You\u2019re not. There\u2019s no prior exchange.</p> <p>Sadly, it works. Opens go up. Some people stay oblivious and a few even convert. But seriously \u2014 how do you look at yourself in the mirror?</p> <p>Respect: Knowing When to Stop</p> <p>No is no. It goes \u2014 should go \u2014 without saying. But if the prospect has to say it out loud, you weren\u2019t listening.</p> <p>If you want to see how deep the madness runs, Google \u201cideal number of touches in an email sequence\u00b9.\u201d You\u2019ll find entire articles explaining why the \u201csweet spot\u201d is somewhere between five and eight touches. Fewer than that and you\u2019re \u201cgiving up too early.\u201d Most replies, we\u2019re told, come from later touches. That might be optimal if your only metric is overall reply rate. It\u2019s far less optimal if you care about the attention tax you impose on society, let alone reputational costs.</p> <p>I think even three is pushing it, even when I\u2019m convinced the person would benefit from hearing from me. Every time an email is ignored is another clue the recipient doesn\u2019t give a shit \u2014 so why keep pressing?</p> <p>\u00b9 There\u2019s a whole industry of tools that will happily automate this for you \u2014 which is basically adding insult to injury, because the sender isn\u2019t even taking the time to notice, let alone care, that you\u2019re not interested.</p> <p>The Work</p> <p>If climbing this ladder feels like a lot of work, that\u2019s because it is.</p> <p>Dirty sales is easy. It\u2019s the path of least resistance \u2014 a system optimised for the sender\u2019s convenience. A numbers game played with other people\u2019s time.</p> <p>Clean sales is harder. It asks for thought, discipline, and real effort. But that effort isn\u2019t a cost; it\u2019s a signal. It says you respect the person on the other end. That you see them as a potential partner, not just an entry in your CRM. It is, in short, an act of empathy.</p> <p>And the work pays. The return isn\u2019t just feeling good about yourself; it\u2019s a business that lasts. Sustainable results. A brand that survives the next quarter. A profession that pulls in great people instead of chewing them up.</p> <p>The lazy path will always be there, waiting.

But these guardians created a new ritual for entry: a theater of fake civility, performed by machines for machines, before a single human is involved. </p> <p>A fork in the road</p> <p>For a business sending email, there are two realities. In the first, a new employee can send  a handful of carefully crafted messages to relevant contacts and expect them to be  delivered. In the second, the same act requires a weeks-long initiation: a ritual of simulated  exchanges performed before a machine that must learn to trust you. The difference between  these two realities is not how legitimate the business is, but how much email it plans to send.  The practice that governs the second reality is known as email warming. </p> <p>Sender reputation is \u2018assumed guilty\u2019</p> <p>At its core, this divergence is a response to how modern email systems police their  networks. Mailbox providers like Google and Microsoft have no history of a new domain\u2019s  behavior. Their algorithms rely heavily on sender reputation, which for a new domain is  non-existent. Any early negative signals are catastrophic, as reputation is cumulative but  hard to repair. </p> <p>A sender\u2019s score is built from a range of signals, including: </p> <ul> <li>Engagement metrics: opens, replies, and read times.  </li> <li>Negative signals: spam complaints and high bounce rates.  </li> <li>Technical authentication: SPF (verifies who can send from your domain), DKIM  (signs messages so they can\u2019t be altered), and DMARC (tells providers what to do if  those checks fail).  </li> <li>Volume and velocity: sudden spikes in sending activity are a major red flag.  </li> </ul> <p>Without a positive history, a high-volume campaign is immediately flagged as suspicious,  condemning messages to the junk folder. </p> <p>Email warming: a rehearsal for reputation</p> <p>Email warming is the process of methodically building a positive reputation before launching a large-scale campaign. </p> <p>It is, in essence, a rehearsal staged to train the inbox algorithms to trust you. Since the precise rules of the algorithms are opaque, the industry has reverse-engineered a set of best practices that imitate the signals of a trusted sender. This shared wisdom has crystallized into something of a ritual that mimics the behavior of a healthy domain over time:</p> <ul> <li>Start with a low volume of emails and increase it gradually.  </li> <li>Send to a network of engaged inboxes that are programmed to open, reply, and  mark emails as important.  </li> <li>Maintain a near-zero bounce rate by using verified lists of these friendly inboxes.  </li> </ul> <p>Many modern sales tools \u2014 including Warmup Inbox, Lemwarm, Instantly, and Smartlead, to  name just a few \u2014 automate this process, creating \u201creply loops\u201d that simulate natural,  two-way conversations and generate the positive engagement metrics algorithms look for.  </p> <p>Why new domains are required</p> <p>Outbound teams rely on email warming because they rarely send from their primary  company domain. The primary domain\u2019s reputation is too valuable to risk on high-volume  outbound. Instead, they register secondary domains (e.g., try-clean.com, get-outbound.io)  specifically for outreach. Each of these new domains starts with zero reputation and must be  warmed individually before being put into rotation.  </p> <p>The same is true for startups sending outbound for the first time. For them, the ritual is  almost literal: a necessary initiation before they can reach a single real prospect.  </p> <p>A simple safeguard becomes the foundation for an entire manufacturing process.  </p> <p>The industry: outbound agencies and farms</p> <p>As companies chased predictable pipeline, a parallel industry emerged to operationalize it.  Outbound agencies and so-called \u201cfarms\u201d manage outreach for dozens of clients at once,  running hundreds of mailboxes across secondary domains. Each inbox must be warmed,  maintained, and retired as reputation fades. A production line of synthetic correspondence.  This isn\u2019t a side effect of bad actors; it\u2019s the logical outcome of trying to scale a behavior that  was never meant to scale. In this economy, trust itself becomes an inventory that is  generated, consumed, and replenished by machines.  </p> <p>In my experience since first stepping into a sales leadership role, roughly two out of every  three unsolicited emails I receive come from these outbound farms, a statistic likely familiar  to anyone with a public-facing role today.  </p> <p>The first Internet: a high-trust network</p> <p>This entire cycle of algorithmic defense and circumvention stems from the original architecture of email. The underlying protocol, SMTP, was created by the same research community that built and ran the ARPANET \u2014 the embryo of the internet, a small high-trust network where participants knew each other by name \u2014 and was designed with no built-in identity layer.</p> <p>(See The Day of the Blast for how that same network produced the first mass email.)</p> <p>In response to the flood of spam that exploited this vulnerability, providers have layered on opaque, machine-learning filters to police the commons. If the rules for gaining trust were transparent, they would be immediately gamed. The result is a system where the only way to prove trustworthiness at scale is to successfully simulate it first.</p> <p>The cost of scaling beyond consent</p> <p>Ultimately, the need for email warming is a declaration of intent. A business that uses email as it was originally conceived, for relevant communication that people would expect to receive, has no need for it. Their natural, human-scale behavior builds reputation organically.</p> <p>The warming ritual exists only to build one thing: a reservoir of algorithmic trust, to be spent on  high-volume reach the moment the company decides to flip the switch. It is the rite of passage  every company must pass through to scale beyond consent. The company pays the cost of this  ritual only once. From then on, the burden is forever externalized, becoming an attention tax  collected on everyone else.  </p>","tags":["email","deliverability","sales","automation","ethics"]},{"location":"posts/from-blacklists-to-black-boxes/","title":"From Blacklists to Black Boxes","text":"<p>What is Bayesian filtering, and how it launched the first AI arms race</p> <p> In 2002, a Lisp programmer wrote an essay about spam.

The dominant mail transfer agent of the 1990s, Sendmail, shipped with relaying enabled by default \u2014 a design inherited from ARPANET, where every node was a trusted colleague. On the open internet, which had inherited ARPANET's architecture but not its manners, this was an unlocked door with a sign reading \"please come in.\"\u00b9 A single operator with a list and a script could push millions of messages through other people's servers without owning a single machine.</p> <p>The economics were startling. Before botnets, spammers acquired their audiences by purchasing physical CD-ROMs containing millions of email addresses scraped from the web. Ten million addresses for fifty dollars. At that price, a single sale of a sixty-dollar herbal supplement paid for the entire database. A mortgage lead-generation firm could send a million emails, watch 990,000 get deleted, see 9,500 opened, 490 clicked, and one person complete a mortgage application \u2014 and turn a profit, because that one qualified lead sold to a lender for fifty to a hundred and fifty dollars, and sending the million emails had cost almost nothing.\u00b2</p> <p>At the top end, Alan Ralsky ran an operation out of suburban Detroit capable of sending one billion emails per day: pump-and-dump stocks, pharmaceutical leads. A billion sends at one-in-a-million conversion still produced a thousand daily hits at fifty to a hundred dollars each, and in a business where the infrastructure was stolen or nearly free, revenue and profit were practically the same number. He was convicted of wire fraud and sentenced to fifty-one months.\u00b3 By then he'd already become a folk hero of irony: the Detroit News profiled his $740,000 home and printed his address, Slashdot users signed him up for every physical junk mail list they could find, and Ralsky, buried under hundreds of pounds of daily mail, complained to reporters: \"These people are out of their minds.\"</p> <p>This was the battlefield: millions of messages per day, sent at near-zero cost, by operators who ranged from outright criminals running advance-fee fraud to grey-market lead brokers selling clicks to real lenders to entirely respectable companies doing their own email marketing, all of whom had simply discovered that the math worked.</p> <p>In 2001, spam accounted for seven percent of global email traffic. By 2002, twenty-nine percent. By June 2003, Brightmail reported that spam had crossed the fifty percent threshold for the first time.\u2074 More than half of all email on the planet was unsolicited.</p> <p>The Open-Book Exam</p> <p>The most widely deployed spam filter was SpamAssassin, an open-source scoring framework maintained by a community of volunteers. Humans hand-wrote detection rules and assigned each a point value. A subject line in all capital letters might score 2.0. The phrase \"free money\" might add 1.5. Excessive exclamation marks, another point. Scores accumulated as a message passed through the ruleset. Cross the threshold (the default was 5.0) and the message was flagged as spam.</p> Germans. Pioneering livecam porn spam since 2003.\u2075 <p>The screenshot above is a SpamAssassin report from 2003. The score reads 5.3, just above the threshold, with every rule that fired listed alongside its point value: the entire logic of the defense, laid bare in the output. A spammer could compose a message, run it through SpamAssassin, read the score, and adjust until it slipped under the threshold. Rewrite the subject line. Drop a trigger word. Add a line of innocuous text. Check again. 4.9. Send. Defense as open-book exam.</p> <p>Other filters were simpler and failed in simpler ways. McAfee's SpamKiller relied on keyword matching: scan for forbidden words, flag the message. The evasion was trivial. V1agra. M0rtgage. Fr.ee. A filter built on spelling was beaten by misspelling.\u2076</p> <p>Brightmail, a commercial anti-spam service used by major ISPs, took a different approach. It deployed a global network of decoy email addresses \u2014 honeypots. When a message arrived at a honeypot, Brightmail computed a digital fingerprint of it and distributed that fingerprint to subscribers. If a real email matched a known fingerprint, it was spam. The system was elegant against true bulk: identical messages sent to millions of addresses all produced the same fingerprint. But it was blind to variation. Change a single character, a comma or a space or a digit in a phone number, and the fingerprint changed entirely. The match failed. The message sailed through.\u2077</p> <p>All three failed differently, but the root cause was the same. Each assumed that spam was a fixed target: a known word, a known pattern, a known message. The attacker only had to change the surface. None of these systems could learn, and none needed to be broken. The defense logic was visible, so the attacker could study it and work backward to evade it.</p> <p>A Plan for Spam</p> <p>In August 2002, Paul Graham published an essay called \"A Plan for Spam\" on his personal website. Graham was a programmer and essayist who had sold his startup Viaweb to Yahoo in 1998, and had since been designing a new programming language called Arc, building a web-based email client to exercise it. The client needed a spam filter. He tried writing rules by hand, got addicted to the competitive game of spotting spam features. \"To recognize individual spam features you have to try to get into the mind of the spammer,\" he wrote, \"and frankly I want to spend as little time inside the minds of spammers as possible.\" He tried a statistical approach instead, and found immediately that it was much cleverer than he had been. The essay was a report on that experiment.\u2078</p> <p>Instead of rules about what spam says, build a model of what spam looks like statistically. Don't match words. Count tokens. Don't write rules. Learn probabilities. The filter would be trained, not programmed.</p> <p>Nobody called it machine learning, let alone Artificial Intelligence, but that's what it was: a system that learned patterns from labeled data and made probabilistic predictions on new inputs. Graham's filter was built on Bayes' theorem, a formula published in 1763 that has been terrorizing college freshmen ever since.\u2079 The theorem describes how to update your beliefs when you encounter new evidence. The easiest way to understand it is to watch it fight.</p> <p>The First AI in Your Inbox</p> <p>A token, in Graham's system, was not a word as a dictionary defines it. It was any character string the parser encountered: a conventional word like \"meeting,\" a cluster of exclamation marks, an HTML fragment like <code>&lt;font color=\"red\"&gt;</code>, a misspelling, a header artifact, a string of digits. The filter did not care what any of these meant. It cared how often each one appeared in spam versus legitimate email.\u00b9\u2070</p> <p>V1agra was not a clever disguise anymore. It was just another token. The filter had never seen it in ham, had seen it constantly in spam, and assigned it a probability near 1.0. The spammer's instinct, change the spelling, ran into a system that didn't read spelling in the first place. Every new mutation was simply a new token to be counted, classified, and filed.</p> <p>But the filter learned something else too: what your email looked like.</p> <p>Before it could classify anything, the filter had to be trained.\u00b9\u00b9 The user fed it two collections: a folder of known spam and a folder of known legitimate messages, which the community began calling \"ham.\" The filter walked through both and counted. How often did each token appear in spam? How often in ham? After training, every token carried a number between 0 and 1 representing how likely a message containing it was to be spam. \"Viagra\" in three hundred spam messages and zero ham messages: probability near 1.0. \"Tonight\" in two hundred ham messages and two spam messages: probability near 0.0. A token never seen before was assigned a neutral 0.4, a slight lean toward ham on the assumption that novel words were more likely to appear in legitimate email than in the repetitive vocabulary of spam.</p> <p>My probability table was different from yours. \"Free consultation\" was strongly spammy for an engineer and perfectly legitimate for a dentist. The words you used every day formed a shield around your inbox. For the first time, the absence of normal language was itself a signal. Every previous filter was a detector of bad signals. Graham's was equally a detector of good. A message saturated in the vocabulary of your daily work, \"invoice,\" \"Tuesday,\" \"the board approved,\" was not merely unpenalized. It was actively protected.</p> <p>In traditional programming, a human writes the logic and the machine executes it. In machine learning, a human provides the data. The resulting model, the thousands of weights and probabilities that determine behavior, is produced by the process, not by the programmer. The programmer can inspect the model. But the model is not a set of instructions anyone wrote. It is a statistical artifact, shaped by data, too large and entangled for any human to hold in their head. No single person, not even the person who wrote the code, could look at a trained filter and predict with certainty what it would do with a given message. You could test it. You could not read it.</p> <p>Graham built this in a few hundred lines of Lisp, running on a single laptop. But the structure was there: training data, probabilistic classification, a verdict that emerged from patterns rather than rules. The first machine to fight for human attention against other machines was a spam filter running in an apartment.</p> <p>Probing the Black Box</p> <p>The industry moved fast. Within eighteen months, Graham's approach had been absorbed into infrastructure at every scale. SpamAssassin integrated a Bayesian engine alongside its hand-written rules; sysadmins could now train a local probability map on their own servers.\u00b9\u00b2 Mozilla Thunderbird placed machine learning at the center of the consumer experience, its \"Junk\" button quietly reframing the act of deleting spam as an act of training.\u00b9\u00b3 Microsoft's SmartScreen aggregated classifications from hundreds of thousands of volunteers to train a single shared model for all of Outlook and Exchange.\u00b9\u2074 The trajectory: personal, personal, then centralized. Each step concentrated more labeling power and more compute in fewer hands.</p> Somewhere, Neil is still waiting for a reply.\u00b9\u00b3 <p>But the moment filtering became a learned model, the contest changed. The attacker was no longer reading a rulebook and finding gaps but probing a black box and mapping its shape.</p> <p>Spammers understood the logic instantly: if ham tokens protect a message, inject ham tokens. They began appending blocks of innocent text to their emails, paragraphs lifted from novels, random dictionary words, fragments of news articles. Some used passages from Moby Dick.\u00b9\u2075</p> <p>The filter would encounter \"whale,\" \"Ahab,\" \"doubloon,\" and \"harpoon\" sitting beneath an advertisement for discount Viagra, and it would hesitate. The math explains why.</p> <p>An email arrives. The filter collects the fifteen most \"interesting\" tokens in the message, the ones whose spam probability is farthest from 0.5 in either direction, and combines them. Fifteen, not all. If the filter weighed every token in the message, a single long paragraph of innocent text could drown the spam signal entirely. By limiting the calculation to the most extreme outliers, Graham forced the attacker to produce very high-quality ham to move the needle. If the email contains \"Viagra\" (near 1.0) and \"pharmacy\" (near 1.0), but also \"whale\" (near 0.0) and \"doubloon\" (near 0.0) and \"harpoon\" (near 0.0), the combined probability shifts. Spam tokens pull toward 1. Ham tokens pull toward 0. The final score is the product of the tug-of-war. Without the Melville, the message scores 0.99. With it, the ham tokens dilute the signal, dragging the probability toward the center, away from Graham's 0.9 threshold. The message slips through. Bayesian poisoning: the statistical symmetry at the heart of the filter, weaponized against it.</p> <p>The more substantive attack was adversarial probing. Sending was free and the filter was a mathematical function. Understanding the model was unnecessary. Mapping it was enough. They set up test labs with private installations of the most popular open-source filters and ran canary messages through them before launching a campaign. If the local filter caught the message, a script would swap synonyms: \"money\" for \"cash,\" \"opportunity\" for \"proposition,\" until the score dropped below the threshold. Machine-learning researchers now call this a substitution attack. In 2003, it was just called getting the email through.</p> <p>At scale, the logic extended beyond local testing. Send a hundred variants of the same pitch to live inboxes. Observe which ones get through. Adjust the ones that don't. Repeat. Each send was a query against the model's decision boundary, and each result, delivered or filtered, was a data point. Over enough iterations, the attacker could trace the shape of the black box from the outside without ever seeing the inside. This was black-box adversarial attack, conducted at industrial scale by people who had never heard the term.</p> <p>Step back and watch the picture: every structural advantage favored the attacker. Sending was free; there was no cost for failure. The model was a fixed mathematical function; it could be mapped. The defender couldn't afford aggressive filtering; a false positive meant a missed invoice, a lost job offer, a deal that never happened. The blame for a false positive always fell on the filter, never on the spammer who caused the noise in the first place.</p> <p>And yet \u2014</p> <p>One Gigabyte and One Button</p> <p>In April 2004, Google offered every email user on earth a gigabyte of free storage. Hotmail gave you two megabytes. Miss a few days of housekeeping and new messages bounced. You deleted emails like you took out the trash: constantly, knowing that anything you kept meant something else had to go. Google was offering five hundred times that. The promise was that you would never have to waste time deleting an email again.</p> <p>A promise like that required a second, quieter one: that the archive wouldn't fill with junk. Google couldn't offer infinite storage without solving spam. So it built a centralized filter trained by its own users. Every time anyone on the platform clicked \"Report Spam,\" the signal updated a model that could vaccinate every other inbox in near-real-time. A campaign that hit a thousand users in the morning could be dead by the afternoon, not because an engineer wrote a new rule, but because the model had learned the pattern from the first hundred clicks and propagated the defense across the entire network.</p> <p>Gmail layered personalized models on top of the global one. Spam for one user could be ham for another. The system didn't just learn what spam looked like in general. It learned what spam looked like to you, and what your legitimate email looked like to it. The Bayesian insight \u2014 that ham is as powerful as spam \u2014 was now operating at the scale of hundreds of millions of inboxes, with a self reinforcing feedback loop: users labeled, the model improved, spam declined, users labeled more confidently.\u00b9\u2076</p> <p>It worked. The inbox, which had been nearly unusable, became functional again. The defenders won.</p> <p>Routing Around</p> <p>By 2007, spam still accounted for roughly ninety percent of all email sent, but almost none of it reached the inbox.\u00b9\u2077 Graham's innovation applied at Google scale had won so decisively that most users quickly forgot there was ever a war. The spammers? Shrugged and moved on.</p> <p>Within months of Bayesian filters becoming standard, spammers rendered their payloads as JPEGs. The pitch that would have scored 0.99 as text was now a single image file. The filter couldn't parse it, tokenize it, or score it. It had nothing to count.</p> <p>When filters learned to read images, the attackers moved to botnets, distributing their sending across millions of compromised home computers. When botnets were dismantled, they moved to snowshoe distribution across thousands of IPs and domains. Each defensive victory was real, and addressed exactly one tactic. Each time, the attacker walked to the next undefended front.</p> <p>The Bayesian victory over text spam was the most impressive. It held. The text front was genuinely won, and it would stay won for twenty years.\u00b9\u2078 When it finally reopened, sometime around 2023,\u00b9\u2079 it wasn't because the attackers had found a way to beat the filter. The conditions that made the filter work had simply disappeared.</p> <p>Semantic Zero-Day</p> <p>The defenders won the first AI war over human attention because of three conditions specific to that era.</p> <p>The first was bulk. A single campaign sent millions of identical or near-identical messages. The moment one user flagged it, the platform could cluster the pattern and kill the campaign across every inbox. The attacker's volume was both the weapon and the weakness. Today, a sender using a language model generates ten thousand unique, personalized messages. There is no pattern to cluster. No campaign to kill. Every message is a semantic zero-day.\u00b2\u2070</p> <p>Then there was compute. No other entity could run probabilistic classification across billions of messages in real time, retrain continuously, and maintain personalized filters for hundreds of millions of users. The defender had a resource advantage the attacker couldn't match. Today, attackers run open-source language models on a single consumer GPU, testing thousands of variations against simulated filters before a single message is sent. The arms are matched. The constraints are not: the defender still can't afford a false positive.</p> <p>The last was the shape of the data. In 2002, the vocabulary of spam and the vocabulary of legitimate email sat at opposite ends of the probability space with almost nothing in between. \"Dear Beloved\" and \"Q3 revenue forecast\" do not share tokens. The statistical distance between the two sides was so vast that even imperfect models worked. You didn't need precision when the target was on the other side of a canyon.</p> Twin Peaks Conceptual 2002 \u2014 The canyon 0 1 Token spam probability Frequency 2025 \u2014 The closing 0 1 Token spam probability Frequency          Ham                 Spam               In 2002, the token distributions of spam and ham occupied opposite ends of the probability space. Bayes' theorem exploited the canyon between them. Today, AI-generated text is collapsing the two peaks into one. The theorem still works. The separation it depends on doesn't.      <p>Today, generative AI occupies the entire linguistic space of legitimacy. The two peaks have collapsed into one. If the defender filters aggressively enough to catch AI-generated outreach, it catches the real thing too. The canyon is closing.\u00b2\u00b9</p> Takeaways <ul> <li>A Plan for Spam triggered the first AI war. Before anyone used the term, spam filters were doing machine learning: training on labeled data, making probabilistic predictions, fighting adversarial attacks at industrial scale. The vocabulary caught up twenty years later.</li> <li>Ham is as powerful as spam. The filter's breakthrough was learning what your email looked like, not just what spam looked like. Your vocabulary became the shield.</li> <li>Scale beat structure. Every structural advantage favored the attacker. Gmail won anyway \u2014 because spam was bulk, compute was monopolized, and the gap between junk and legitimate email was a canyon.</li> <li>The canyon is closing. That victory depended on a vast gap between legitimate and illegitimate text. AI is erasing it. The win of 2004 was a truce.</li> </ul> Footnotes <p>\u00b9 The \"unlocked door\" was a literal design choice. Sendmail, the era's dominant Mail Transfer Agent, prioritized the ARPANET's \"trusted node\" philosophy over security until Sendmail 8.9 (May 1998) finally disabled relaying by default. For the technical evolution of the \"Open Relay\" and the first retaliatory blocking efforts, see Paul Vixie, The Mail Abuse Prevention System (MAPS) and the RBL (1996). As Vixie famously noted, the internet had inherited the architecture of a small village but was being populated like a metropolis.  <p>\u00b2 The $50 price point for ten million addresses was a staple of late-90s \"Bulk Email\" CD-ROMs, often advertised via the very spam they facilitated. These figures and the $50\u2013$150 mortgage lead \"bounties\" are documented in FTC, \"Report to Congress: National Do Not Email Registry\" (2004). For a contemporary look at the \"math of annoyance,\" see \"The Economics of Spam,\" Salon (April 18, 2000), which illustrates how a near-zero marginal cost per send rendered traditional conversion constraints obsolete.  <p>\u00b3 U.S. v. Ralsky et al. (2009). The DOJ confirmed his operation netted roughly $3 million in a single quarter of 2005. The Detroit News profile that prompted the Slashdot retaliation was published in December 2002; Ralsky's complaints about the resulting deluge appeared in the Detroit Free Press shortly after.  <p>\u2074 The \"50% threshold\" is sourced to the Brightmail \"Spam Index\" (June 2003). The broader trend\u2014from 8% in 2001 to 36% in mid-2002\u2014is aggregated in European Commission, COM(2004) 28 final, Section 1.1, and Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project (June 2003). For the subsequent climb toward a 90% \"noise floor\" by 2007, see the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG), Email Metrics Reports. This period represents the \"Great Clogging\" of the internet, where infrastructure was nearly overwhelmed by its own lack of authentication.  <p>\u2075 This specific scoring output\u2014a common sight for system administrators in 2003\u2014captured a German \"livecam\" porn campaign. The headers illustrate the transition from simple keyword checks to structural analysis, where the filter penalized the message more for its \"encoding anomalies\" (2.1 points) than its actual content. SpamAssassin, formalized by Justin Mason in 2001, effectively turned email defense into an \"open-book exam\" because its ruleset was public, allowing spammers to \"score\" their own messages and iterate until they hit a 4.9. See Justin Mason, \"Filtering Spam with SpamAssassin,\" Proceedings of the USENIX Annual Technical Conference (2002). Image: Wikimedia Commons, \"Reco spam.png,\" created 20 July 2003, Apache License 2.0.  <p>\u2076 The shift to \"V1agra\" and \"M0rtgage\" was a direct response to the keyword-matching logic of early retail filters like McAfee SpamKiller. By 2003, the Federal Trade Commission noted in its Spam Forum reports that simple text-based filtering had become a \"temporary palliative\" easily bypassed by trivial misspellings. For an early taxonomy of these linguistic evasions, see John Graham-Cumming, The Spammer's Compendium (2004).  <p>\u2077 Brightmail (acquired by Symantec in 2004) pioneered the use of \"honeypots,\" maintaining a global network of over 2 million decoy addresses by 2003. While elegant, the fingerprinting method was defeated by \"hash-busting\": the practice of appending random, invisible strings of text to the end of a message. This ensured that every individual email in a million-message blast had a unique digital signature, rendering the central fingerprint database blind to the variation.  <p>\u2078 Paul Graham, \"A Plan for Spam,\" paulgraham.com (August 2002). The quotes in the main text are drawn directly from the essay, in which Graham describes both his addiction to the \"competitive game\" of hand-writing rules and his revulsion at the process. Graham's proposal grew out of a programming-language project (Arc) that led him to build a web-based email client, which needed a spam filter. Because Graham already commanded a significant following through essays like \"Beating the Averages,\" the \"Plan\" functioned as an immediate call to action for the technical community and is widely credited with shifting the industry focus from blacklists and rules to statistical probability models.  <p>\u2079 The Reverend Thomas Bayes (1702\u20131761) never published the theorem himself. It appeared posthumously in \"An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances,\" published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1763, edited and submitted by his friend Richard Price. The formula in its modern notation: P(A|B) = P(B|A) \u00d7 P(A) / P(B). In the spam context: P(spam|tokens) = P(tokens|spam) \u00d7 P(spam) / P(tokens). If that notation is the reason you avoided statistics in college, the prose version in the main text is functionally equivalent.  <p>\u00b9\u2070 Tokenization\u2014the process of splitting text into discrete units\u2014was an established technique in information retrieval decades before its application to spam. The foundational work is attributed to Gerard Salton's Vector Space Model (1960s\u201370s) at Cornell, where documents were represented as vectors of term frequencies. Graham's specific innovation was applying this to personal email corpora, including non-word tokens like HTML fragments and punctuation. See Gerard Salton, Anita Wong, and C.S. Yang, \"A Vector Space Model for Automatic Indexing,\" Communications of the ACM 18, no. 11 (1975).  <p>\u00b9\u00b9 In this context, \"training\" refers to supervised learning: a process where a human provides labeled data (spam vs. ham) for an algorithm to analyze. While \"training\" has since become a cornerstone of AI discourse, in the early 2000s it was a manual user action\u2014typically dragging emails into folders or clicking a \"Report Spam\" button. Every such click in a modern inbox is a direct descendant of the supervised learning models popularized during this transition.  <p>\u00b9\u00b2 SpamAssassin 2.50 was a hybrid by design. The Bayesian engine did not replace the existing hand-written heuristics\u2014it sat alongside them as an additional weighted score. A high Bayesian spam probability might contribute 3.5 points to a message's total, often enough on its own to push it past the default 5.0 threshold. The <code>sa-learn</code> command-line utility allowed system administrators to feed the Bayesian component with local mail corpora, meaning each server's model reflected the specific spam landscape of its user base. This hybrid architecture\u2014rules for known patterns, statistics for unknown ones\u2014became the dominant paradigm for server-side filtering through the mid-2000s. See the Apache SpamAssassin documentation and release notes for version 2.50 (March 2003).  <p>\u00b9\u00b3 Image sourced from cybertopcops.com, \"Thunderbird Junk Mail Training.\" Thunderbird's Adaptive Junk Mail Controls were based on a Bayesian classifier that required an initial training corpus of approximately 200 messages (100 ham, 100 spam) before reaching reliable accuracy. The design decision to place \"Junk\" and \"Not Junk\" buttons prominently in the toolbar was not incidental\u2014it transformed a filtering mechanism into a feedback loop, making the act of classification visible and habitual for ordinary users. Thunderbird was, quietly, the first mass-market application that required its users to teach it before it could work.  <p>\u00b9\u2074 Microsoft's SmartScreen filter represented the first large-scale shift from local to centralized training. The Spam Confidence Level (SCL) scoring system rated each message on a 0\u20139 scale, with Exchange administrators able to set thresholds for delivery, junk folder routing, or outright rejection. The training corpus was built from the classifications of hundreds of thousands of volunteers in Microsoft's Feedback Loop program. This approach\u2014aggregating human judgments at platform scale to train a single shared model\u2014prefigured the architecture Gmail would deploy the following year at vastly greater scale. See Microsoft, \"SmartScreen Technology in Outlook 2003,\" Microsoft TechNet (2003).  <p>\u00b9\u2075 Bayesian poisoning, also known as \"word salad\" or \"hash-busting text,\" became widespread by late 2003. The technique exploited the statistical symmetry at the heart of Graham's design: if the filter weighted ham tokens as heavily as spam tokens, then injecting enough ham tokens could neutralize the spam signal. Common sources for filler text included Project Gutenberg novels, news wire feeds, and random excerpts from Wikipedia. Graham himself addressed the attack in a follow-up essay, \"Better Bayesian Filtering\" (January 2003), proposing refinements including more aggressive token selection and devaluation of long, context-free text blocks appended to messages. The arms race had begun within months of the original essay's publication.  <p>\u00b9\u2076 When Gmail launched on April 1, 2004, its one gigabyte of free storage was roughly 500 times what Hotmail offered. The storage also meant users kept more email for longer, generating a richer ham corpus for the Bayesian models to train on. More legitimate email in the archive meant a more detailed statistical portrait of each user's communication patterns, which made the personalized filter more accurate. The generosity of the storage and the quality of the filter were not separate features. They reinforced each other. See Gmail launch announcement, Google Blog (April 1, 2004); for the competitive context, see Steven Levy, In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2011).  <p>\u00b9\u2077 Barracuda Networks, analyzing over one billion daily email messages across 50,000 customers worldwide, estimated that 90\u201395% of all email sent in 2007 was spam. MAAWG's concurrent estimate, based on over 100 million mailboxes, placed \"abusive email\" at 85% of incoming traffic. See MAAWG Email Metrics Reports (2007).  <p>\u00b9\u2078 The text front was not entirely dormant during this period. Gmail introduced Priority Inbox in 2010, a second model trained not on the difference between spam and ham but on which legitimate emails a user was most likely to care about \u2014 who they replied to fastest, which threads they opened immediately. This and similar refinements represented the defense getting smarter within a won position, not responding to a renewed offensive.  <p>\u00b9\u2079 OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022 and GPT-4 in March 2023. Open-source language models capable of generating personalized outreach at scale proliferated through that year, and the sales and marketing tooling to operationalize them \u2014 integrations with CRMs, sequencing platforms, and sending infrastructure \u2014 matured through 2024. The \"reopening\" was not a single event but a gradual capability crossing a threshold: the moment the cost of producing a unique, linguistically legitimate message dropped to near zero.  <p>\u00b2\u2070 In cybersecurity, a zero-day is a vulnerability that is unknown to the defender and therefore has no existing patch or signature. A \"semantic zero-day\" here means a message that has never been seen before and shares no linguistic pattern with any previously flagged message, rendering pattern-based detection useless.  <p>\u00b2\u00b9 The mathematical structure of the \"canyon\" is a shift in probability distributions. In 2002, the distribution of token probabilities across spam and ham was bimodal: two distinct peaks with a wide valley between them. Bayes' theorem could exploit this easily because the prior probability of a token like \"Ahab\" appearing in spam was nearly zero \u2014 P(Ahab|Spam) \u2248 0 \u2014 so even if the rest of the message looked suspicious, that single token anchored the classification. Today, the distribution is collapsing toward a single peak. A language model can generate a perfectly context-aware email about \"Ahab\" to a maritime historian, and the P(Ahab|Spam) value is no longer a reliable anchor. The theorem still works. The separation it depends on doesn't.","tags":["spam","AI","machine-learning","email","bayesian-filtering"]},{"location":"posts/intent-data/","title":"Explainer: Intent Data","text":"<p>What is \"Intent Data\", how is it manufactured, and why is it (probably) wrong most of the time</p> <p> The promise of intent data is to replace guesswork with a clear signal of who will buy next.

This promise has fueled a multi-billion dollar market, with over 70% of B2B go-to-market teams now using intent data in some form.  </p> <p>Yet for a product this valuable, its origins are surprisingly opaque. To understand what\u2019s really being sold, it helps to follow the trail back to its source.  </p> <p>Bidstream: the raw material</p> <p>The story begins, unexpectedly, in advertising.</p> <p>When a webpage loads, the empty rectangle where an advert will appear doesn\u2019t yet have a buyer. In the milliseconds before it becomes visible, an automated dynamic auction takes place. Hundreds of bidders receive a tiny packet of data \u2014 the page\u2019s topic, device type, rough location, and IP address \u2014 and decide whether to bid. If that packet shows a reader in Florida in July, for instance, air conditioner companies are far more likely to bid higher and win the auction.</p> <p>The primary purpose of each dynamic auction is to sell a single ad impression, so the value of the broadcasted data packet was never intended to be more than ephemeral, lasting only long enough to price that one moment of attention.</p> <p>But publishers and ad exchanges soon realized there was a by-product \u2014 the trail of metadata left by billions of such auctions \u2014 that was a valuable asset in its own right. This aggregate trail is the bidstream. A secondary market quickly formed, with data brokers emerging to buy, aggregate, and resell this torrent of data.</p> <p>Guessing and dressing identities</p> <p>The enrichment vendors that buy these feeds face a simple obstacle: the data show what pages were viewed, but not who viewed them. To turn a potential intent signal into something a marketeer or salesperson can act on, they must first guess which company it came from.  </p> <p>That task falls to IP-mapping vendors like KickFire, Clearbit Reveal, and Leadfeeder. They maintain huge databases linking IP address ranges to corporate networks. Some of those links come from public routing records \u2014 the internet\u2019s address book \u2014 but most are inferred from observation. If traffic from a certain range keeps hitting both Salesforce documentation and Salesforce\u2019s careers page, the algorithm quietly labels that network \u201cSalesforce.\u201d  </p> <p>Once the web traffic is associated with companies, enrichment firms take over. They classify the pages being read into business topics like \u201cHR system migration,\u201d \u201cpayroll software,\u201d or \u201cWorkday alternatives.\u201d When enough visits from one network cluster around a theme, the system records a \u201ctopic surge.\u201d Some vendors go further, layering in other data points\u2014hiring trends, funding rounds, technology installs\u2014to build what they call \"composite intent signals\", the claim being that combining many weak indicators yields a stronger, more reliable signal.</p> <p>To put a bow on it</p> <p>By now, the data has already passed through several hands. The ad exchange sells the packet, the broker sells the feed, and a chain of specialists reshapes it: IP-mapping firms guess which company each address belongs to; enrichment vendors classify pages into business topics and aggregate these patterns into the composite \u201cintent\u201d scores. </p> <p>And finally, platform integrators like ZoomInfo and 6sense package this manufactured signal for go-to-market teams. Marketing uses it for account-based targeting; sales uses it to prioritise outreach. The dashboard turns those probabilities into something that looks decisive: \u201cAcme Manufacturing - HR system migration interest up 28% week over week\u201d.</p> <p>Acme Manufacturing</p> <p>Lean back and watch the full motion unfold.  </p> <p>A job candidate, connected to the guest Wi-Fi while waiting in the lobby of Acme Manufacturing, scrolls through the websites of Workday and BambooHR: two other firms where he\u2019s also applied for roles.  </p> <p>Each site he visits fires a bidstream ping. An ad exchange broadcasts the details; a data broker captures the packet and sells the feed. Days later, at an enrichment firm, that lobby Wi-Fi\u2019s IP address is matched to Acme Manufacturing, the candidate\u2019s browsing is tagged as corporate-level interest in \u201cHR system migration,\u201d and the activity registers as a surge.  </p> <p>The surge alert enters BambooHR\u2019s marketing automation system, where Acme Manufacturing\u2019s account score ticks upward, finally hitting some arbitrary threshold, which flags it as a Marketing-Qualified Account and routes it to Sales. A task is queued in the CRM for John, an SDR at BambooHR. After returning from his coffee break, he places a call.  </p> <p>The phone rings in the office of Acme\u2019s Head of People Ops, the very manager who interviewed the candidate. She picks up, still drafting a polite rejection note, and hears:  </p> <p>\u201cI noticed you\u2019re exploring new HR systems.\u201d  </p> <p>Where the guesswork breaks</p> <p>The common critique of intent data is that its signal is weak because context is lost at each step: turning a page view into an IP address, an IP into a company, and a company into a trend. But this framing is too generous. It implies a real, person-level signal existed at the start, only to be stripped of its meaning.  </p> <p>The opposite happens. The process begins with something inherently indeterminate \u2014 anonymous web traffic\u00b9 \u2014 and adds layers of conjecture. Fidelity isn\u2019t lost; it\u2019s invented, dressing up a statistical guess until it looks like a data point worth acting on.  </p> <p>The weakest link is identity mismatch, the attempt to map that anonymous web traffic to a specific company. Audits put accuracy near 40\u201350%, far below the 80\u201390% vendors claim. Remote work, shared offices, and cloud infrastructure all blur IP identity. Two providers may disagree on which company an IP belongs to, so the same browsing activity can register as intent from entirely different firms. And even when they\u2019re right, the match only narrows the activity to a company, never to a person.  </p> <p>The next distortion is manufactured statistical certainty. Composite scoring blends different data types \u2014 hiring surges, funding rounds, new software installs \u2014 to make a weak signal look stronger. But these signals are rarely independent. A company that has just raised funding is also likely to be hiring and buying software. Since the clues point to the same underlying event, they don\u2019t triangulate a target, they simply reinforce one assumption. The model grows more confident without becoming more accurate, mistaking correlation for certainty.</p> <p>Another flaw is semantic drift in topic detection. Every \u201csurge\u201d depends on vendor-specific taxonomies \u2014 \u201cHR software,\u201d \u201ccontract management,\u201d \u201ccloud migration\u201d \u2014 derived from automated classifiers that interpret page text and metadata. Vendors revise these opaque taxonomies without notice, so changes in classification often reflect model drift, not market behaviour. A single page can be labeled differently across providers or model versions, creating semantic drift that mirrors shifts in the classifier, not in buyer intent.  </p> <p>The final limitation is latency. The auction that produces the bidstream happens in milliseconds; the enrichment and reporting cycle takes days or weeks. By the time a score appears in a dashboard, the behaviour it describes is often already stale.  </p> <p>The industrial logic</p> <p>Yet the system endures, and for rational reasons. Weak signals are not worthless. In a high-volume outbound model, even a tiny probabilistic edge compounds at scale. A one- or two-point lift in response rate, spread across thousands of prospects, pays for itself many times over.  </p> <p>That\u2019s why intent data fits so neatly into the industrial go-to-market philosophy: it offers direction: just enough to keep the outbound factory running, turning a small statistical edge into a licence for volume.  </p> <p>The vanishing raw material</p> <p>The industry has long weathered scrutiny over the unreliability of its manufactured signals. But it now faces a truly existential threat, one that targets not the quality of the signal, but its very existence. The entire market was built on a single, fragile assumption: that the torrent of human curiosity, expressed as page views, would flow forever.  </p> <p>That assumption is now breaking.  </p> <p>As AI assistants handle more of the early research process, users get answers without opening a page. In 2024, SparkToro and SimilarWeb found that more than 65% of Google searches ended without a click \u2014 a record high \u2014 and early evidence suggests AI answer boxes will push that number higher still. Publishers see the same trend: Semrush and Parse.ly report year-on-year declines in organic traffic across B2B and informational sites.  </p> <p>For business buyers, the shift is sharper. A procurement manager who once searched \u201cbest contract-management software\u201d now asks ChatGPT or Claude and receives a synthesised answer instantly. No page view means no auction, no bidstream, and nothing to map.  </p> <p>This shift to conversational AI presents a fundamental challenge.

As research activity moves from public web pages to private AI chats, the visibility required for bidstream auctions disappears.  </p> <p>The raw material of this market is human curiosity expressed as a page view, and the industry is running out of curiosity to sell.</p> <p> \u00b9 A curated alternative to the raw bidstream is the data cooperative model, often associated with vendors like Bombora. In this model, a network of B2B publishers agrees to share anonymized visitor data, yielding a higher-quality signal about the topic being researched (the what). Crucially, however, it still depends on the same probabilistic IP-to-company mapping to determine where that research originates (the who), and therefore does not solve the fundamental identity and context challenges outlined here. </p>","tags":["intent","data","sales","analytics","ethics"]},{"location":"posts/outbound-is-dirty/","title":"Outbound is Dirty","text":"<p>Modern cold outbound sales is a dirty business. But it doesn't have to be.</p> <p>Sales, as a human occupation, is essential and fundamentally good. At its core, sales is about helping people discover, understand, and ultimately buy the products or solutions a company offers. The very fact that customers willingly complete these transactions is proof enough that these products deliver real value. Seen this way, sales acts as a lubricant, a catalyst: it shortens the gap between potential value\u2014the promise of what the product could do\u2014and realized value, which the customer experiences once they purchase and use it.</p> <p>The world simply cannot function without sales.</p> <p>And yet, sales often ends up dirty, and cold outbound sales is particularly so. It generates pollution in the same way a chemical plant produces waste. To manufacture a profitable compound, the factory inevitably creates byproducts. When that waste is discharged into a river, the cost isn\u2019t borne by the factory but passed downstream to communities living beside it.</p> <p>Economists call this a negative externality: a cost imposed on third parties who neither chose nor benefit from the transaction.</p> <p>Noise pollution is another example. A nightclub generates profit for its owners and entertainment for its customers, while neighbors\u2014who didn\u2019t vote for any of it\u2014lie awake at 3 AM, robbed of sleep and peace of mind. Worse still, as they stare at the ceiling, they can\u2019t help but picture the club owner raising a glass to a successful night.</p> <p>Outbound sales creates similar negative externalities, ones I\u2019ve always found hard to ignore when building sales operations. The pollution isn\u2019t audible like noise or visible like waste, but it\u2019s just as real. It appears as overflowing inboxes, interrupted conversations, and minutes stolen from our concentration. Individually, these costs seem trivial. But multiplied millions of times, they become a burden carried by society\u2014imposed without consent or consultation, like those neighbors kept up by the nightclub.</p> <p>Companies evaluate outbound programs using familiar metrics: the volume of outreach (emails, calls), conversion rates into qualified leads, and the percentage of those leads that become paying customers. Success is declared when the total value of closed deals exceeds the cost of running the program.</p> <p>Those costs are typically calculated as the sum of data acquisition and validation, sales tooling (CRM, sequencing software, automation), outreach efforts (calls, emails, meetings), sales team compensation, marketing collateral, and, to a lesser extent, overhead like compliance and operations.</p> <p>What\u2019s never tallied in this equation are the costs outbound pushes onto everyone else. But if they were factored in\u2014using the same cold numerical logic we apply to leads, deals, and returns\u2014outbound might be designed very differently.</p> <p>There\u2019s another dynamic at play in cold outbound, one that mirrors a well-known dilemma from environmental science.</p> <p>The tragedy of the commons, a concept popularized by ecologist Garrett Hardin in the 1960s, describes how shared resources tend to be overused when individuals act in their own immediate self-interest. In Hardin\u2019s example, several shepherds graze animals on a common pasture; each benefits by adding more livestock, but the damage from overgrazing is shared by all. Eventually, the resource collapses\u2014and everyone loses.</p> <p>Sales faces a similar dynamic. The common pasture is customer attention. These are people who might genuinely benefit from our product, if we could just hold their interest for a few minutes. But that same customer lives in a swarm of competing offers, each salesperson acting rationally by sending one more email, making one more call, leaving one more message.</p> <p>The result: an ecosystem choking on excess. Attention\u2014once relatively abundant\u2014has become scarce, expensive, and increasingly immune to capture, another casualty of a system that generates value by offloading its costs on time, focus, and consent at massive scale.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.</p> <p>The assumption that waste is an unavoidable byproduct of sales isn\u2019t a law of nature. It\u2019s a consequence of how we choose to operate: how we build teams, run programs, and measure success.</p> <p>So: is it possible to build a truly Clean Outbound?</p> <p>That\u2019s the question I explore on these pages: whether outbound programs can be reimagined to drastically reduce the negative externalities we\u2019ve come to accept as normal\u2014and, just as critically, whether they can match or even outperform the effectiveness of the conventional, \u201cdirty\u201d systems that dominate today.</p> <p>Because unless it delivers real results, Clean Outbound is just another elegant theory collecting dust.</p>","tags":["sales","ethics","outbound","externalities","attention","systems"]},{"location":"posts/parasitic-sales/","title":"Parasitic Sales","text":"<p>How companies hijack your instincts to keep you on the line</p> <p> Cold calling works by hijacking evolved social instincts that made sense in small groups and turn against us in the environment of call queues and call quotas. Once you recognise the mechanism, you have every right to protect yourself. Hang up. </p> <p>A visitor in the nest</p> <p>The cuckoo watches from a hidden perch, waiting for the warbler to leave its nest. As soon as the coast is clear, she flies in, lays her egg in seconds, and takes off, often carrying away one of the originals to keep the number the same.</p> <p>Soon after, the warbler returns. Inside are eggs that look exactly like hers. She settles in, warming them without the slightest suspicion.</p> <p>The match is so close the warbler does not notice the intrusion. That cuckoo egg hatches earlier than the rest, revealing a chick already larger and stronger. Within days, it pushes the other eggs, her own offspring, out of the nest entirely.</p> <p>She continues to feed it because the cuckoo chick has evolved to trigger her parental instincts with ruthless precision. The colour of its gape, the pitch of its begging call, and the timing of its hunger are tuned to match or outcompete her own young. Evolutionary biologists call this brood parasitism, the exploitation of one species\u2019 instincts by another.</p> <p>Richard Dawkins, in The Selfish Gene, uses the cuckoo as a vivid example of how natural selection favours strategies that exploit pre-wired behaviours. What\u2019s striking is not that the warbler loses, but that it loses by doing exactly what it has evolved to do. The cuckoo does not need speed or force. It wins by presenting the right signals in the right sequence and letting instinct carry out the rest.</p> <p>The deception works because it targets instincts that cannot be switched off. Even when the truth is obvious, the impulse to feed still wins \u2014 much like picking up the phone out of habit when an unfamiliar number flashes on the screen.</p> <p>Our own wiring</p> <p>We like to think of ourselves as different from the warbler. After all, we\u2019ve got consciousness, reasoning, choice. Surely that protects us from being manipulated by a beak and some chirping.</p> <p>But we also run on instincts \u2014 survival mechanisms shaped over hundreds of thousands of years in an environment where living in a group was the difference between life and death. Politeness, reciprocity, and conflict avoidance weren\u2019t \u201cnice-to-haves.\u201d They were survival code. In small, tightly knit groups, returning a favour kept you in good standing. Avoiding unnecessary conflict meant fewer injuries and stronger cooperation when hunting or defending the group. Responding when addressed signalled awareness and respect, reinforcing bonds that might one day save your life.</p> <p>Over many generations, these behaviours became second nature, reinforced by the survival advantages they brought in the ancestral environment. Those same reflexes now operate in a world of call queues, unknown numbers, and scripted pitches. And like the warbler\u2019s feeding reflex, they can be triggered by the right cues, whether or not the source is genuine.</p> <p>The phone rings</p> <p>Your phone rings. The number\u2019s unfamiliar.</p> <p>You could ignore it, but curiosity, another ancient instinct, taps you on the shoulder. You pick up. The voice on the other end is warm, confident, friendly. They use your name. They ask how you are, and you answer automatically, even though you\u2019ve never met. Only a few seconds in do you realise this is the electricity company, the one that calls every few months with a \u201cspecial rate\u201d that somehow always turns out higher than the one you have now.</p> <p>There\u2019s a shift: part irritation, part guilt. You want to hang up. You also don\u2019t want to be rude. It\u2019s a small but effective trap. You know you don\u2019t want what they\u2019re offering \u2014 yet the polite thing to do, the instinctive thing, is to hear them out.</p> <p>A fine-tuned system</p> <p>The only thing that matters to the people running it is conversion. And conversion goes up when you stay on the line. Whether it\u2019s because the person in charge of outbound is consciously borrowing from the cunning of the cuckoo, or simply the cumulative result of decades of trial and error in call centres (just like biological evolution), we\u2019ve ended up with a system that essentially hijacks your social instincts.</p> <p>The friendly opening. The first-name greeting. The pace and tone of the voice. Each detail tested, refined, and sharpened until it tugs at your wiring just enough to keep you from hanging up.</p> <p>What I find most irritating is that the people who sign off on these tactics will never face you. They don\u2019t hear the sigh in your voice or feel the tension of staying polite while someone burns your time. That part is outsourced to the people on the phones, often underpaid, under pressure, and not to blame for the strategy they\u2019re carrying out.</p> <p>Your frustration has nowhere to go. You hang up, but the system remains untouched. And each call makes you fractionally quicker to cut the next one short.</p> <p>The numbers</p> <p>In Q1 2025, consumers in North America and Europe were hit with 12.5 billion spam and fraud calls; about 137 million a day. Spam now makes up 44 % of unidentified calls in France, 42 % in Spain, and 22 % in the U.S. (Hiya, Q1 2025; Q3 2023).</p> <p>So it\u2019s no surprise that 94 % of European consumers believe unidentified calls are likely spam or fraudulent (Hiya/GSMA, 2022). The share of adults who usually answer unknown numbers has collapsed over the last decade \u2014 to 19 % in the U.S. (Pew, 2020) and 28 % in the UK (YouGov, 2022) \u2014 and the real surprise is that those figures aren\u2019t even lower.</p> <p>Each unwanted call trains us to be quicker to hang up\u2014or never pick up\u2014on the next one. The damage compounds, and over time answer rates fall and conversion follows. No amount of brand spend buys that back. The irony is that companies can spend millions polishing their brand and, in the same quarter, grind it down with tactics that make people less likely to ever pick up again.</p> <p>Just hang up the phone</p> <p>If a reed warbler could suddenly understand the cuckoo\u2019s trick, it wouldn\u2019t hesitate. It would shove the cuckoo chick over the edge the moment it recognised the threat.</p> <p>The chick itself isn\u2019t the villain, but it\u2019s still part of a parasitic system. Same with the voice on the line: they\u2019re just the visible part of a machine built to drain your time for someone else\u2019s gain.</p> <p>Once you spot the pattern, hanging up is not only perfectly reasonable \u2014 it\u2019s an act of self-protection. Your attention and goodwill are finite, and the system is designed to spend them. You\u2019re under no obligation to feed it.</p>","tags":["ethics","sales","outreach","behavioural-science"]},{"location":"posts/praxos-vs-cleanthes/","title":"Praxos vs. Cleanthes","text":"<p>Six strong arguments for conventional outbound, and the case for a cleaner alternative.</p> <p>Steam hissed from the espresso machine, a counterpoint to the clink of ceramic. Praxos slid into the booth with the unhurried haste of a man who lives on calendars and quota math. Cleanthes was already there, hands around his cup as if coaxing a confession from it. The small talk, if there had been any, was already exhausted.</p> <p>PRAXOS: You have the luxury of paragraphs. I live in dashboards. Outbound works because it\u2019s a controllable input. I turn a dial, meetings appear. It isn't pretty, and Lord knows people hate it, but my board doesn't fund pretty. They fund a healthy, predictable pipeline.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: Pipeline is oxygen. I\u2019m not here to argue against breathing. I\u2019m here to ask what your lungs are made of. If every breath deposits a little scar tissue, at what point do you stop calling it health?</p> <p>PRAXOS: Spare me the poetry. Let\u2019s speak plainly. Outbound is math. Two SDRs\u2014my kids making the calls\u2014one good list. One hundred touches a day. A handful of meetings, a couple of opportunities, one closed deal. The rest is rounding error.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: What's in the \u201crounding error\u201d column, Praxos? Wasted focus. The friction you pushed onto strangers. The filters you helped train to ignore you. The future buyers who now associate your brand with interruption. You keep the revenue on your P&amp;L and push the cost onto the market's balance sheet. A debt like that always comes due.</p> <p>PRAXOS: So you frame it as a moral question. Fine. I\u2019m not allergic to morality, but I am responsible for keeping the lights on. Let's get serious. I'll give you the strongest case for conventional outbound. You try to break it.</p> <p>ARGUMENT #1: IF WE DON\u2019T OUTBOUND, WE DIE</p> <p>Praxos leaned forward, the energy in the booth shifting from debate to deposition.</p> <p>PRAXOS: One: We are small. We have no gravity. Without a brand, without content, without events, we have two levers that move without asking permission: knock on doors and shout into inboxes. We pull those levers, or we die. Don't tell me to wait for word of mouth. Payroll is on Friday.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: When the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail you have to hit a hundred times. I remember the panic of that payroll. The mistake is to let panic write your strategy. You're right, you have to create motion. But spray and pray creates heat, not light. Precision creates a light that compounds.</p> <p>PRAXOS: Heat is a signal. Heat is meetings. Heat is a pulse. You talk about \u2018light\u2019 as if it\u2019s some immaculate thing we can discover through quiet contemplation. A startup can\u2019t afford analysis paralysis disguised as \u2018precision.\u2019 We find the light by creating heat. We make a hundred calls to learn what the ten best calls would have been. There is no other way.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: I\u2019m not arguing for contemplation. I\u2019m arguing for leverage. A good general doesn't send his entire army to probe the enemy's line. He sends scouts, gathers intelligence, and then concentrates his force where the wall is weakest. That is not paralysis; it is strategy.</p> <p>PRAXOS: Sometimes you don\u2019t know where the wall is weakest until you\u2019ve touched all of it. Volume is how you discover the map.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: Then let\u2019s discover on purpose. Small, capped sampling passes to learn, freeze to think, and only then concentrate fire where the veins are live. Use volume for discovery, but focus for yield.</p> <p>ARGUMENT #2: IF THEY KNEW WE EXISTED, THEY\u2019D WANT US TO EMAIL THEM</p> <p>PRAXOS: Your entire model is based on a flawed premise: that we need to discover where the value is. It\u2019s a luxury of the uncertain. We already know the value. We know the pain is real. The only variable we need to solve for is reach, and that brings me to the foundation of my second point: we are not selling snake oil. We fix a real, painful problem. The introduction is cold because the world is noisy, not because our intent is malicious. If they knew what we do, they'd thank us for the interruption.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: Good intent doesn't absolve you of the cost of your delivery. It's the difference between a tap on the shoulder and tapping everyone in the room because one of them might have a headache.</p> <p>PRAXOS: Your analogy is flawed. This isn't a quiet room; it's a storm. A battlefield. A tap on the shoulder is silence. It gets lost. You need a signal flare to be seen through the chaos. The minor annoyance of that flare is a tiny price to pay for the person who is truly lost and needs rescue. We are selling rescue.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: Then the goal isn't to be a louder flare, Praxos. It\u2019s to be a smarter one. The world is awash in noise. The only way to cut through it is not with volume, but with relevance. That's the different frequency. You make the flare itself a gift of value\u2014an insight, a piece of data, a benchmark they actually don\u2019t have\u2014so that even those who don't need rescuing are glad they looked up. That is how you earn the right to send the next one.</p> <p>ARGUMENT #3: MY REPS HAVE MORTGAGES (SO DO I)</p> <p>PRAXOS: Gifts of value\u2026 you make it sound like we\u2019re a think tank. We are a sales floor. We try. We add insights. You know what happens. Silence. Unsubscribes. And then the meetings. Not many, but enough. The board doesn't applaud our ethics. They applaud our bookings. Which brings me to my third point.</p> <p>Praxos\u2019 voice dropped, the bravado replaced by a raw, immediate pressure.</p> <p>PRAXOS: My reps have mortgages. So do I. I need a plan that closes a gap now.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: And I respect that pressure. More than you know. I've been the one staring at that calendar... But the desperate sprint to solve for now is precisely why you're always in this crisis. It\u2019s a treadmill. You\u2019re burning all your energy just to stay in the same panicked place, quarter after quarter. The speed you feel is an illusion, paid for by making next quarter harder. The only way to close the gap sustainably is to stop digging the hole deeper.</p> <p>PRAXOS: You're talking about next quarter. My CRO asks me, \u2018How many meetings did your team book this week?\u2019 Your philosophy is a fine retirement plan, but I\u2019m fighting a war this quarter. Brand equity and trust don\u2019t show up on a weekly dashboard. I can\u2019t report vibes on Tuesday.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: Then don\u2019t report vibes. Report efficiency. For every thousand doors you knock on, how many real conversations do you start? Not just meetings, but actual positive replies. And track the opposite. How many people slam the door in your face\u2014the unsubscribes, the spam reports? That\u2019s not a vibe, Praxos. That's your supply line. It is the earliest possible signal of the health of the ground you're drilling in.</p> <p>PRAXOS: That sounds slow. All that upfront research, building new rails for tracking... what if the \u201cperfect well\u201d is dry? And how does that help my rep who is at 20% of their monthly quota on the fifteenth?</p> <p>CLEANTHES: You don't turn off the old engine before the new one is running. You dedicate a small, protected fraction of your effort to being geologists. Not for a whole quarter, but for a single, focused sprint. The goal in that sprint isn't to close deals; it's to build a better map. To conduct a short survey of the terrain and find the richest ground. If you don't find a stronger signal with less resistance, you stop. The experiment is small, the risk contained.</p> <p>ARGUMENT #4: I CAN\u2019T PLAY CLEAN IF THE GAME IS RIGGED</p> <p>PRAXOS: A bet. That\u2019s what it is. And it ignores the game-theory angle. My competitors are fighting a knife fight. If I play clean while they all defect, I'm the sucker who loses. My primary duty is to help my team win. To tell my soldiers to bring a polite letter to a knife fight is professional malpractice.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: You're right. In a knife fight, bringing a letter gets you killed. But you're looking at the wrong fight. You're so focused on the man with the knife in front of you that you haven't noticed the arena's walls are closing in on you both. The spam filters, the call screeners... the buyer's cynicism: that is the real opponent. Your competitor's knife can't touch it. But every time he swings wildly, he makes that wall move a little faster for everyone, including you.</p> <p>ARGUMENT #5: OUTBOUND KEEPS THE ECONOMY MOVING</p> <p>PRAXOS: Even that frame is too small. We're talking about tactics. Let's talk about GDP. Let's talk about jobs. What do you think we do? We move value from where it is created to where it is needed. That is the foundational act of any economy. Without a proactive sales motion, great products die on the vine. Companies stagnate. Hiring freezes. Every annoying email is a tiny, fractional cost of that gigantic value creation. It is the cost of doing business. Not my business. All business.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: I would never argue against connecting solutions to problems. The question isn't whether we should connect, but how. You\u2019re defending the efficiency of the engine by ignoring the cost of the fuel. What is the cost in broken trust? In the cynicism that now blankets the entire profession? An economic system that runs on burning trust is, by definition, unsustainable.</p> <p>ARGUMENT #6: THE MARKET LEARNS BECAUSE WE POKE IT</p> <p>PRAXOS: Unsustainable? It's the only thing that creates what's next. A sustainable, 'clean' system is a closed loop. My final point is this: true innovation doesn't ask for permission. The market learns because we poke it. Our job is to solve problems people don't even have the language for yet. That requires interruption. You're arguing for a cleaner river. I'm arguing that the river's current is what powers the whole damn city.</p> <p>Cleanthes nods slowly.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: That is the most honest defense I have ever heard. And you are right: progress doesn't ask for permission. But you're confusing the act of exploration with the method of clear-cutting. History has two explorers: the wildcatter who drills a hundred holes hoping to get lucky, and the geologist who studies the terrain to know where to drill one. Both are proactive. But only the geologist's model compounds. The wildcatter's depletes. That's the difference. Clean isn't about waiting for permission. It\u2019s about earning the right to interrupt through the sheer quality of your hypothesis.</p> <p>Spare me the philosophy: what does my BDR do at 9 a.m.?</p> <p>Praxos stared into his empty cup for a long moment, turning it slowly on the saucer. The aggressive certainty had finally settled, leaving a quieter, more pragmatic weight in its place.</p> <p>PRAXOS: A geologist, huh? ...You're still smuggling aesthetics in as ethics. But you've at least grounded it in a logic of efficiency. So let\u2019s be specific: What happens when the geologist's map is wrong? When the single, perfect well comes up dry and the calendar is empty on the fifteenth of the month?</p> <p>CLEANTHES: Then you have a reserve of higher-friction plays you use like an emergency flare, not like your daily strategy. You run them with integrity, you learn from it, and you improve the map. This isn't about purity. It's about stewardship.</p> <p>PRAXOS: You gave me an ethos. I asked for a checklist.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: The checklist is the shadow of the ethos. I'll bring you both. We'll build it so your team can run it without guesswork. If it doesn\u2019t move your numbers, throw it out.</p> <p>PRAXOS: Bring me the checklist. And the dashboard that proves your signals are improving while the calendar fills. The numbers will make it culture.</p> <p>CLEANTHES: Deal.</p> <p>The barista called out an order. The steam wand hissed once more, steady and indifferent.</p>","tags":["outbound","clean-sales","ethics","debate"]},{"location":"posts/the-cost-of-cold-email-part-1/","title":"The Cost of Cold Email (Part I)","text":"<p>A Fermi estimate of an unpriced externality</p> <p> Cold B2B email extracts at least $25 billion worth of attention each year. The burden falls disproportionately on the people with the highest leverage in their companies. In isolation, each message feels like a harmless nuisance. Aggregated across millions of inboxes, their cost rivals regulated economic externalities. </p> <p>The twelfth email</p> <p>A VP of Sales at a SaaS company that has just announced a Series B begins her day with twelve cold emails in her inbox. She deletes eleven without opening them as her eyes flick down the list. The twelfth is from a vendor whose product she actually needs, but she deletes it too. The reflex has already taken over.</p> <p>Three time zones east, a CMO at a cloud infrastructure company opens his laptop hoping to finish a quarterly update for his team before lunch. Unbeknownst to him, his marketing department posted a job listing the night before. His phone buzzes. New email. Subject line: \"Following up on our conversation.\" He opens it. A vendor he has never heard of offers to help him scale his team. He screenshots the message and drafts a LinkedIn post about questionable outreach tactics. The quarterly update will wait until after lunch.</p> <p>In London, a founder closes a tab containing a term sheet from her lead investor. She had meant to reply that morning, but the email had slipped below the fold overnight, buried under nineteen messages from sales automation platforms, recruiting firms, and an AI startup that wants to help her \"scale founder-led sales.\" She finds it three hours later. By then, her investor has pinged her board member to ask whether everything is alright.</p> <p>A few days later, the VP of Sales receives a follow-up to that twelfth email. It is the second touch in a four-touch sequence programmed by the same go-to-market engineer behind all the outreach described above. This time she opens it. It is relevant, though she resents the invented familiarity in the subject line. A few weeks later, her company becomes a customer.</p> <p>The CMO and the founder will never know this, but their lost time and attention underwrote the seller's discovery of the VP of Sales. Millions underwrite this every day.</p> <p>How big is their cost?</p> <p>I did not ask for this Big Mac</p> <p>The first burden of an unwanted email is the time it takes to process it.</p> <p>A recipient sees a subject line and, judging it irrelevant, deletes it. A few seconds. Occasionally they read. A few seconds more. Rarely do they respond. Even then, the time is measured in seconds or minutes, perhaps small enough to ignore.</p> <p>The larger cost is recovery: the time required to return to the task that was interrupted. Experimental studies show that workers take at least ten minutes to fully resume a task after an interruption.\u00b9 The seconds of processing are dwarfed by the minutes of recovery.</p> <p>A skeptic objects: most people batch-process email. They check once an hour, handle everything at once, and pay the recovery cost only once, not per message.</p> <p>The objection is half right. Pure batching would share recovery across the batch. But pure batching is rare. Phones buzz. Notifications leak through. Subject lines catch the eye mid-meeting.</p> <p>In practice, batching is imperfect. Some emails break through in real time \u2014 call it batch leakage. If even a fraction of cold emails act as interruptions, recovery time dominates. At 40% leakage, the expected cost of processing and recovery per cold email is on the order of a minute.\u00b2</p> <p>Now price that time.</p> <p>Assume our VP of Sales earns $250,000 a year in total compensation, a fair figure for a VC-backed SaaS scale-up. That places the cost of her time at roughly $125 per hour. One minute of interruption is about two dollars and twenty cents, the price of a McDonald's coffee.</p> <p>But compensation prices time, not output. A single decision by a senior leader can redirect the work of dozens of people, reallocate millions in spend, or alter the trajectory of an entire quarter. Standard labor economics values a worker's output at roughly three times their compensation to cover salary, benefits, and overhead. That cost-coverage logic does not apply to senior decision-makers, who are hired to generate returns rather than break even. In practice, their leverage is often much higher.\u00b3 I will use a conservative multiple of five times compensation.

The goal is to map the victims, count their wounds, and weigh the damage.</p> <p>LinkedIn has roughly 360 million users in North America and Europe.\u2074 Narrow to managerial or decision-making roles and the number drops to around 39 million.</p> <p>Of these, about 27 million sit outside the typical B2B sales Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). They hold titles that suggest authority but work in industries, company sizes, or functions that outbound teams rarely target. They might see a cold email every week or two.</p> <p>Narrow again to those inside the ICP and the number falls to 12 million. Of those, 7 million are \"champions\" \u2014 directors and senior managers who influence purchasing decisions but lack final authority. They receive around ten cold emails per week.</p> <p>The remaining 5 million \u2014 VPs, C-level executives, and founders \u2014 sit at the tip of the cone. Our VP of Sales sits here too. So does the CMO drafting his LinkedIn outrage post and the founder who ignored her investor.</p> <p>At the tip, the volume explodes. The modern sales stack is built on shared intelligence: vendors buy the same contact databases, filter for the same \"decision-maker\" titles, and react to the same signals. When a company announces a Series B or posts a job listing, it acts as a flare gun, triggering thousands of automated sequences simultaneously. The moment an inbox becomes valuable to one seller, it is likely becoming valuable to many others too.</p> <p>The average recipient in this tier absorbs thirty per week. The top decile sees fifty or more, with upper-bound cases in high-activity sectors exceeding a hundred</p> Compression at the tip The 5 million at the tip of the cone receive more cold email than all other roles combined Self-reported role People \u2190 \u2192 Daily cold email            VPs, CXOs &amp; Founders           within B2B Sales ICP 5m 30m            Directors &amp; Sr Managers           within B2B Sales ICP 7m 14m            All the above roles           outside B2B Sales ICP 27m 3m          Population figures from LinkedIn Sales Navigator (December 2025). Roles are self-reported, and people inflate their titles, so the tip of the cone is likely smaller. But self-reported titles are what sellers use for targeting, so the volume distribution holds. Daily email volumes are estimates.\u2075 North America and Europe only.        <p>Sum the volume. The base of the cone absorbs a trickle. The middle absorbs a steady stream. The tip absorbs a flood. Aggregated across these tiers, roughly 50 million cold emails land in the inboxes of managers and executives every day across North America and Europe.</p> <p>Your total bill sir</p> <p>Now multiply.</p> <p>At the McDonald's coffee estimate \u2014 $2 per email, compensation-based, no leverage adjustment \u2014 that is roughly $100 million per day, or over $25 billion per year across North America and Europe.</p> <p>At the Big Mac meal estimate \u2014 $11 per email, adjusted for executive leverage \u2014 the figure rises to over $500 million per day. Over a year, it exceeds $130 billion. These figures cover only North America and Europe. A global estimate would add perhaps another 20 to 30 percent.</p> <p>A fair objection:\u2076 the model assumes similar exec pay and leverage across all 39 million recipients. Does everyone earn like our VP of Sales?</p> <p>In reality, compensation and leverage vary across the cone. The 5 million at the tip likely earn more than $250,000 and carry leverage well above 5x. The 27 million at the base earn less and carry lower leverage. But volume follows the same gradient: those at the tip receive the most email, those at the base the least. The errors largely offset. If anything, the estimate is conservative: the people receiving the most email are precisely those whose time is most expensive.</p> Methodological cross-check: a sender-side estimate <p>       We have sized the burden by counting the victims and their wounds. We can also size it       by counting the shooters and their bullets.     </p> <p>       LinkedIn shows roughly 290,000 people in North America and Europe with SDR-related       titles, and another 300,000 Account Executives (AEs) who send at least some cold       outreach.\u2077 Industry benchmarks suggest Sales Development Reps (SDRs) send around       40 new prospects into sequences per day; AEs far fewer, perhaps three.\u2078     </p> <p>       A standard four-touch sequence multiplies each enrolled prospect by roughly three       emails.\u2079 Working through the math yields approximately 38 million cold emails per day       in North America and Europe.     </p> <p>       This figure is lower than the recipient-side estimate, likely because it excludes       founder-led sales, recruiting outreach, and, especially, the long tail of outbound       agencies and consultants. These last players are hard to count, as they do not carry       SDR or AE titles, yet they run fully outsourced operations across multiple clients. As a       result, they fire a disproportionate share of the bullets.     </p> <p>       At an $11 cost per email this approach yields roughly $105 billion per year. The       count-the-victims and count-the-shooters methods disagree on magnitude, but they       agree on scale: the cost is measured in hundreds of billions.     </p> <p>The sludge</p> <p>The direct cost of cold email is time. But cold email also imposes a system-level effect: it degrades trust in the inbox itself.</p> <p>Think of airport security before and after 9/11. Before, you walked to the gate. After, you arrive two hours early, remove your shoes, unpack your laptop, and stand in line. The threat is rare and the overwhelming majority of passengers pose no risk. The friction applies, however, to everyone.</p> <p>The behavioral economist Cass Sunstein coined a term for this kind of friction: sludge, a muck that accumulates in human systems and slows everything down.\u00b9\u2070</p> <p>A partner sends a message with the subject line \"Quick question.\" In a clean inbox, you click immediately. In a polluted inbox, you pause. You hover over the sender name. You check the domain. You scan for tells. The subject line uses familiar camouflage to mimic legitimate correspondence. \"Re: our conversation.\" \"Following up.\" \"Quick question.\"</p> <p>If you ignore the email, another arrives three days later. Modern sales tools automate persistence. The same thread returns to the top of your inbox, forcing you to make the same decision again. The sludge compounds.</p> <p>Why not simply delete everything unfamiliar? Because the cost of missing a real signal could be high. Among the noise, there might be a message from a potential acquirer, a journalist, or a partner. The cost of missing a legitimate signal forces vigilance. You cannot afford to skim, so you stay alert even when you would rather not.</p> <p>How large is this friction? It cannot be measured directly, but it can be bounded.</p> <p>Decision-makers at the tip of the cone, the 12 million champions and executives inside the ICP, spend roughly two and a half hours per day on email.\u00b9\u00b9 At a leverage-adjusted hourly value of $875, that represents nearly $7 trillion in time value spent on email annually across North America and Europe.</p> <p>If sludge adds just 5 percent friction to email processing, the cost is roughly $340 billion per year. Even at 1 percent, a drag you wouldn't register consciously, it's $70 billion.</p> <p>Even at the low end, the second-order cost of sludge exceeds the direct cost of cold email itself.</p> <p>In good company</p> <p>How much is $25 billion?</p> <p>One way to answer that is in comparison to other negative externalities\u2014 costs imposed on third parties who did not choose to bear them\u2014 that societies already track and regulate.</p> Annual cost of selected externalities All figures in USD billions\u00b9\u00b2 Ocean plastic pollution 13 Cold email, \u2615 McDonald's coffee estimate 25 Noise pollution 45 Cold email, \ud83c\udf54 Big Mac meal estimate 130 Nutrient water pollution 157 Air pollution from transport in cities 183 Cold email, \ud83c\udf54 Big Mac meal estimate + 1% sludge 1% sludge 200 Motor vehicle crashes, economic cost only 340 Cold email, \ud83c\udf54 Big Mac meal estimate + 5% sludge 5% sludge 470          Ocean plastic pollution is a global estimate. Noise pollution and air pollution from transport are EU estimates. Nutrient water pollution and motor vehicle crashes are US estimates. Cold email estimates cover North America and Europe. The astute reader will object that these are not like-for-like figures. They are correct, but missing the point.        <p>These figures come from different models and measurement methods. The question is not whether the burdens are identical in nature, but whether they sit in the same economic range. On this scale, cold email is unremarkable.</p> <p>At the conservative end, its cost exceeds the global damage from ocean plastic pollution. At the leverage-adjusted level, it rivals the impact of nitrogen and phosphorus contamination in US waterways. Including sludge, it sits in the same range as the economic cost of motor vehicle crashes in the United States.</p> <p>These are not marginal nuisances. They are large, persistent burdens that justify regulation, monitoring, and public debate. By scale alone, the attention cost of cold outbound belongs in the same category. Yet it remains largely untracked.</p> <p>There is an obvious moral difference. Email does not poison lungs, erode topsoil, or cause physical injury. But consider \u201cjunk fax\u201d.</p> <p>In the 1990s, unsolicited fax advertising, junk fax, became so widespread that the U.S. Congress banned it. The legal battle was so fierce that it dragged on for decades, reaching the Supreme Court as recently as 2019.</p> <p>Why did we spend thirty years fighting over a relic? Because the cost to recipients was tangible:\u00b9\u00b3 paper, toner, machine wear. You could hold the wasted paper. You could measure the depleted toner. That tangible burden was roughly $200 million a year in today's dollars\u00b9\u2074, and that was enough to trigger a federal ban.</p> <p>We regulate smokestacks because the smoke is seen and soot piles up over time. We regulate noise because everyone hears the same late party and decibels can be measured. We regulated junk fax because you could hold the waste in your hand. Cold email leaves nothing: nothing to measure and nothing to hold.</p> <p>A red herring</p> <p>What about the carbon?</p> <p>Global email volume is vast: roughly 375 billion messages a day. A persistent claim holds that all this traffic carries a meaningful carbon footprint, with every message adding 4 grams of CO\u2082 to the atmosphere.</p> <p>The claim has been debunked repeatedly.\u00b9\u2075 Credible estimates of global email energy use converge around 2 to 5 TWh per year\u2014less than the UK spends boiling kettles, less than the United States spends on Christmas lights, less than the world spends streaming cat videos. Cold B2B email is a rounding error within that rounding error: 50 to 70 million messages against 375 billion, perhaps 0.02 percent of the total.</p> <p>The carbon argument was always a distraction. Energy is cheap, and getting cheaper. Attention is scarce, and getting scarcer. The problem with cold email was never the electricity.</p> Footnotes <p>\u00b9 Experimental work on task interruption consistently finds long recovery times relative to the interruption itself, commonly in the range of 10 to 16 minutes for knowledge work. The estimates that follow use 10 minutes. See, for example, Gloria Mark et al., \"The Cost of Interrupted Work: More Speed and Stress,\" and related literature on attention switching and task resumption.  <p>\u00b2 This is a modeling assumption, not an empirical measurement. The 40% figure reflects a mixed pattern in which most email is processed in batches and some interrupts work in real time. The conclusion is robust to wide variation in this parameter, because recovery time dominates processing time.  <p>\u00b3 Estimates of executive leverage vary widely by role and context. Studies and practitioner analyses often place senior executive or CEO impact in the range of 10\u00d7 to 20\u00d7 compensation, sometimes higher in high-growth or capital-intensive settings. These figures are not used for calculation here; they illustrate why cost-coverage multiples common for individual contributors are inappropriate benchmarks for senior decision-makers. See Jensen &amp; Murphy (1990) and subsequent work on executive incentives and decision impact.  <p>\u2074 Population figures derived from LinkedIn Sales Navigator queries (December 2025). The 360 million represents total LinkedIn users in North America and Europe. The 39 million narrows to Director, VP, C-level, Owner/Partner, and Experienced Manager titles. Further filtering by company size (10\u20135,000 employees), company type (privately held, public, or partnership \u2014 excluding self-employed, non-profit, government), and industry (excluding Retail, Hospitality, Government, and similar) yields approximately 12 million inside the typical B2B sales ICP. Of these, roughly 5 million hold VP, C-level, or founder titles.  <p>\u2075 Industry surveys suggest higher volumes. EmailToolTester (2025) found that the average professional receives roughly 15 cold emails per week, with 6.7% receiving more than 30. Snov.io (2025) reports that 37% of B2B decision-makers receive more than 10 per week. Since decision-makers are a minority of all professionals yet receive a disproportionate share of outbound volume, these averages imply significantly higher figures for the tip of the cone. Against this backdrop, the estimates used here\u2014one cold email every two weeks for managers outside the ICP, 10 per week for champions, 30 per week for deciders\u2014sit at the lower end of what the data supports.  <p>\u2076 Another fair objection: some executives have personal assistants who filter their inboxes on their behalf. This is true, but it shifts the cost rather than eliminating it \u2014 the PA's time has value too. More importantly, only a small fraction of executives have this support. The U.S. has roughly 300,000 executive assistants in total, and only a subset of those actively manage their executive's inbox as a primary duty. Against a population of millions of decision-makers, the vast majority manage their own email.  <p>\u2077 LinkedIn Sales Navigator queries (December 2024). SDR-related titles include: Sales Development Representative, Business Development Representative, Inside Sales Specialist, Inside Sales Representative, Outbound Sales Specialist, Outbound Sales Representative, and Appointment Setter. AE-related titles include: Account Executive, Junior Account Executive, Senior Account Executive, Enterprise Account Executive, Field Sales Specialist, Field Sales Representative, Field Sales Executive, Sales Consultant, and Senior Sales Representative. Using those titles you get to about 1m Account Executives, but not all AEs send cold outreach; the 300,000 figure represents an estimate of those who do.  <p>\u2078 Industry benchmarks vary. The Bridge Group reports 40 emails per day (plus 40 calls and 16 LinkedIn touches). Salesloft suggests 30 emails per day (150 per week). Apollo recommends a limit of 50 per day. Gartner (TOPO) reports 95 total touches per day across channels. Klenty reports a range of 36\u2013100 emails per day depending on the SDR. The estimate of 40 new prospects enrolled per day for SDRs reflects the lower-middle of this range.  <p>\u2079 A standard four-touch sequence (Day 1, Day 4, Day 8, Day 14) with 10\u201315% attrition at each step (from replies, bounces, and opt-outs) yields roughly 3.2 emails sent per prospect enrolled. The model uses a multiplier of 3 for simplicity.  <p>\u00b9\u2070 Sunstein defines sludge as friction that impedes beneficial action: administrative burdens, verification steps, paperwork that discourage people from accessing things they are entitled to. His canonical examples are bureaucratic, including voter registration, benefits enrollment, and tax filing. The inbox is a private-sector version of the same phenomenon. See Sunstein, \"Sludge Audits,\" Behavioural Public Policy (2019).  <p>\u00b9\u00b9 Research on executive time use suggests leaders spend roughly 24 percent of their working hours on electronic communication. See Porter and Nohria, \"How CEOs Manage Time,\" Harvard Business Review (2018). The 2.5-hour figure is a conservative baseline for decision-makers who manage their own inboxes.  <p>\u00b9\u00b2 Ocean plastic pollution costs reflect global damages to marine ecosystems, fisheries, and tourism (UNEP; see also Beaumont et al., \"Global ecological, social and economic impacts of marine plastic,\" Marine Pollution Bulletin, 2019). Estimates for noise pollution in the European Union are based on aggregated EU environmental cost assessments (European Commission / EEA). Nutrient water pollution costs in the United States reflect economic impacts of nitrogen and phosphorus contamination, including treatment and productivity losses (EPA and related studies). Air pollution from road transport in EU cities reflects health and productivity costs attributed to urban vehicle emissions (EEA). The economic cost of motor vehicle crashes in the United States, excluding the value of lost life, is estimated at approximately $340 billion using 2019 data, as reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (published 2023). Figures are rounded and intended for order-of-magnitude comparison.  <p>\u00b9\u00b3 Visibility or tangibility were not the only factors. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 included a $500-per-fax statutory penalty, which gave plaintiffs a concrete incentive to pursue class actions. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, by contrast, provides no equivalent private right of action, one reason, among others, why cold email has not faced the same legal pressure.  <p>\u00b9\u2074 Estimated recipient-side cost of junk faxes (U.S., 1997). I anchor this estimate on 1997 because it marks the point at which junk faxing became a legally and economically salient externality, following the first significant TCPA class actions, most notably Kenro, Inc. v. Fax Daily, Inc., which demonstrated that unsolicited fax advertising could generate large, credible liability under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Using an installed base of ~10\u201315 million fax machines in the United States in 1997, based on contemporaneous industry adoption data (inevitablehuman.com; ProQuest telecom archives), an average of ~100+ unsolicited faxes per machine per year, consistent with reports of millions of junk faxes per day nationwide (reportjunkfaxspam.com), and a conservative per-fax recipient cost of ~8\u201310\u00a2 covering paper, toner, and brief clerical handling, I estimate a total annual recipient-side burden of ~$100 million in 1997 dollars. Adjusted for inflation using CPI data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (1997\u21922025 \u2248 2\u00d7), this corresponds to ~$200 million per year in 2025 dollars.  <p>\u00b9\u2075 The \"4g CO\u2082 per email\" figure, popularized by Mike Berners-Lee, misattributes fixed data-center infrastructure costs to individual messages. The marginal cost of transmission is effectively zero \u2014 most energy expenditure comes from the device already running while the email is composed, energy that would be consumed regardless. Credible estimates from the IEA (2\u20133 TWh/year), the Carbon Trust (1\u20134 TWh/year), the Shift Project (~2 TWh/year), and the Journal of Industrial Ecology (1\u20135 TWh/year) all converge on the 2\u20135 TWh range. Berners-Lee's upper bound of 110\u2013130 TWh/year is now considered outdated. See Andrew J. Whelton's \"4g CO\u2082 per email\u2014Really?\" for the full breakdown.","tags":["sales","outbound","email","economics","ethics"]},{"location":"posts/the-cost-of-cold-email-part-2/","title":"The Cost of Cold Email (Part II)","text":"<p>Why reaching people who've never heard of you used to work, but not anymore</p> <p> Cold outbound was built on a simple formula: more emails, more pipeline.

Aaron Ross drives through the morning fog of San Francisco on his way to his new gig at Salesforce. In his mind, a system is taking shape. Three years later, after huge success, he'll write it down and call it Predictable Revenue.</p> <p>His timing is perfect. By the turn of the century, email had replaced fax as the default mode of corporate communication.\u00b2 The channel was open, uncrowded, and ready to be used.</p> <p>The early days felt different from today. People complained about email almost from the beginning, but cold B2B outreach was minuscule compared to what it would become. A well-crafted, properly targeted, personalized email had a good chance of being opened and read.</p> <p>Labor enforced a natural constraint. A human could write and send a small volume of high-quality emails, or a higher volume of mediocre ones. The tradeoff was real and unavoidable. Quality and volume were inversely linked.</p> A human can only do so much Conceptual Quality vs Volume Volume Quality Performance vs Quality Quality Performance Performance vs Volume Volume Performance          Pre-automation               In a pre-automation world, quality decreases with volume\u2014a human can only do so much. Scaling volume forces performance to decline in lockstep, since quality drives performance.      <p>The only way to increase volume without sacrificing quality was to hire more people. That made labor the binding constraint, which created pressure to get more output from each hire.</p> <p>This is where Aaron Ross enters the story. His innovation at Salesforce was organizational: split prospecting from closing, create dedicated roles, measure the handoffs. The prospecting role became the SDR. The closing role became the AE. It was a Ford moment for sales. The assembly line applied to pipeline.</p> <p>Once sales became an assembly line, the logic of the factory took over. How do you make an assembly line better? You speed it up. You remove bottlenecks. You increase throughput.</p> <p>Jevons</p> <p>Predictable Revenue made sales legible as a system, but throughput was still bounded by humans. Organizational design could only go so far. Tools followed, gradually accreting what we now reverentially call \"the sales tech stack.\"</p> <p>Sequencers automated the cadence. Contact databases replaced guesswork with unified lists. Enrichment layers removed the friction of manual research. AI writing compressed email copy from minutes to seconds. Each layer removed a constraint. Every time a constraint was removed, more volume followed.</p> The Stack: Seven layers of efficiency volume Layer What it solved Why volume followed Contact data aggregation ZoomInfo, Apollo, Lusha, Clearbit Guessing email formats, patching multiple lists \u2192 unified and complete contact database. More contacts accessible, more contacts pursued. Sequencing Outreach, Salesloft, Apollo, Instantly Sending emails one by one \u2192 automated cadences that send on schedule and track engagement. One rep could run hundreds of prospects simultaneously. Intent data Bombora, 6sense, G2, TrustRadius Guessing who was ready to buy \u2192 signals based on web behavior and content consumption. Signals created permission to reach new prospects. Enrichment Clearbit, Clay, UserGems, BuiltWith Researching each account manually \u2192 auto-filled company size, tech stack, funding, job changes. Removed friction on how many accounts a rep could work. Email warming Instantly, Warmbox, Lemwarm, Mailreach Domain sending limits \u2192 simulated engagement to accelerate ramp up. More volume was the point from the start. AI writing Lavender, Regie.ai, Copy.ai, Jasper Writing each email manually \u2192 generated or rewritten copy at scale. Removed the time cost of writing personalized emails. Signals / triggers Common Room, Koala, Pocus, UserGems Manually monitoring news and LinkedIn \u2192 automated alerts for job changes, funding, usage. Every trigger became a reason to reach out. <p>One odd feature of efficiency is that it predictably increases total use instead of reducing it. William Stanley Jevons documented why in the 1860s studying Britain's coal industry. When something becomes cheaper to use, people find more uses for it and consume more of it overall. When steam engines became more efficient, coal consumption didn't decline. It spread: to factories, mills, transport. Britain burned more coal, not less.</p> <p>Efficient lighting gave us Times Square and 24-hour cities. Video conferencing multiplied the number of meetings and attendees.\u00b3 Cheaper storage made us hoard data we'll never use. Faster bandwidth gave us infinite streaming.</p> <p>So every time a new layer of the stack made sending emails cheaper, companies found more reasons to send.</p> <p>Saturation</p> <p>It's striking how similar the promise is for every new tool in the stack: decouple quality from volume, and results will scale. The hypothesis always appears correct at first, and never stays correct for long.</p> <p>Each new adopter sends more. So does the next. And the next. When volume across the channel compounds, the same quality stops yielding the same results.</p> <p>This is what's going on at the moment. The inbox has filled. The recipient who once received a handful of cold emails per week now receives dozens per day. Open rates down double digits year over year.\u2074 SDR headcount cut by more than a third.\u2075</p> <p>Saturation pushes senders to adjacent channels. Look around. Google Doc invitations with a pitch in the first paragraph. Slack Connect requests.\u2076 Calendar invites (Google has thankfully caught up with this). When the front door stops working, the bold are the ones who climb through the window.</p> When everyone has the same tools Conceptual Quality vs Volume Volume Quality Decoupling Performance vs Quality Quality Performance Decoupling Performance vs Volume Volume Performance Saturation          Pre-automation                 Automation                 Expected with Automation               Automation decouples quality from volume\u2014quality scales. But when everyone scales, saturation decouples performance from quality. The result: performance falls short of previous expectations at every level of volume.      <p>Agents Are Different</p> <p>An agent is software that pursues an objective on its own. You give it a goal: book meetings with CFOs at mid-market fintechs. It figures out the path: Monitor signals, enrich leads, write messages, send, handle replies.</p> <p>The stack before agents ran on conditional logic. If open, then send. If click, then enrich. Humans configured the rules, observed the output, adjusted the flow. Humans stood in the center of the loop.</p> <p>Agents change the control system. They remove the human from the loop. With the human go two brakes on volume.</p> <p>The first is operational (can't). Humans must review lists, interpret context, adjust what isn't working. Cognitive load, fatigue, management overhead. A team has finite capacity.</p> <p>The second is reputational (won't). The human has her name on the email, her face on LinkedIn. She carries compliance exposure. She hesitates to burn territory she has to live in.</p> <p>Agents remove both brakes. No operational constraint: marginal cost approaches zero, cognitive load is eliminated, oversight becomes optional. No reputational constraint: no name attached, no reputation at stake, no reason to hesitate. What remains are chosen limits, written in code that says \"do not send more than X per day\" or \"do not contact if Y.\"</p> <p>Chosen constraints are voluntary, making them vulnerable to pressure: from competitors, from your board, from your mortgage. The careful agent books ten meetings. The aggressive one burns a thousand extra prospects but books twenty. You're behind quota so you relax the limits. Then, perhaps, you remove them.</p> <p>The pressure is already here. Kyle Poyar has recently framed it starkly:\u2077</p> <p>\"We've entered the have and have not era of AI in B2B go-to-market.\"</p> <p>Lack of adoption represents an existential threat. So GTM teams read Poyar, study the workflows he documents, and adopt.</p> <p>How It Breaks</p> <p>Without human review cycles to spread activity over time, two convergences emerge.</p> <p>The first is timing. When a prospect posts a job listing, closes a funding round, or installs a new technology, multiple agents detect the signal simultaneously. Each decides this is the moment to reach out. Without human review cycles to stagger the response, they act in the same window.</p> <p>The second is action. Agents arrive at similar tactics because they share structural constraints. Every agent runs on one of a handful of LLMs. The playbooks are public\u2014GTM engineers share workflows like recipes. The same Clay tables, the same enrichment waterfalls, the same triggers.

All personalized, just like they should be.</p> <p>Signaling quality becomes exceedingly hard. When every message looks the same, none stand out. The rational response is more volume. But more volume makes signaling harder. The trap: compensating for declining performance requires doing more of the thing that causes decline.</p> <p>Other channels hit this trap and survived. Digital ads, influencer marketing, SEO\u2014all saturated, none collapsed. In each case, quality was legible before attention was paid: brand in ads, identity in influencers, domain authority in search.</p> <p>Cold email has no equivalent. At the subject line, every sender looks identical. To know if an email is worth reading, you have to read it. When saturation crosses a threshold, recipients stop inspecting. They cannot differentiate, so they assume everything is a lemon.\u2078 While digital ads, influencer marketing, SEO got harder and more expensive, cold email loses its signaling function for most senders, most of the time.</p> <p>Good sellers cannot get through.

AI can filter too.</p> <p>Google and Microsoft are deploying AI to screen inboxes, along with Fyxer, Perplexity, and a growing list of AI assistants for Outlook and Gmail. Instead of the VP scanning fifty subject lines, an AI reads the emails, evaluates relevance, surfaces only the ones worth opening. The attention cost shifts from human to machine.</p> <p>If this works, the $25 billion attention tax disappears. The burden shifts from human labor to machine computation. The lemons problem is solved, with quality signaling again through a filter. The channel survives. Maybe improves.</p> <p>If the filter works poorly, too much gets through. The VP still faces a flooded inbox. We're back to square one. But if it works well, senders adapt. They always do. And here's the challenge for Google and the others: AI filters can be reverse-engineered in ways humans cannot.</p> <p>You can probe an AI filter at scale. Send ten thousand variants, observe what gets through, map the boundary, iterate. With a human, you get one shot per message. No feedback. No systematic learning.</p> <p>Underneath, an AI filter is an objective function,\u2079 a math problem. Enough volume reveals its boundaries. Humans don't work that way. There's no formula for earning someone's attention.</p> <p>Once a channel is policed by AI, reaching the inbox becomes an engineering problem, not a social one. The senders who win are not the ones who write the most relevant messages. They're the ones who solve the puzzle fastest.</p> <p>This is where agents return. The sender is no longer a human adapting content. The sender is an agent. The filter is an AI. Two systems negotiate access to human attention while the human sits behind the wall, unaware she's become the subject of a conversation she's not part of.</p> <p>This echoes email warming, where machines already perform fake civility for other machines. The agent-vs-filter dynamic is the same theater, extended to the inbox itself.</p> <p>The channel still looks like communication. Messages sent, messages received. But the actual exchange happens between machines. The human is the endpoint, not the participant.</p> <p>It's hard to see an equilibrium where AI filtering saves cold email for senders. Either the filter fails and the problem remains. Or the filter succeeds and the channel becomes a negotiation between machines, with humans as the nominal destination but not the actual audience.</p> <p>If cold email loses its ability to signal, you have to bring the signal from somewhere else.</p> <p>Stored Energy</p> <p>Cold outreach dies. Everything that survives is warm: warmbound, intros, brand-assisted outreach. None are cold nor permissionless. And definitely not cheap.</p> <p>All require stored energy: attention earned elsewhere, relationships built before the ask, reputation that preceded you into the room. You are spending access, not creating it.</p> <p>Those with reserves exit. Leaving a collapsing channel is rational once you're convinced there's no money left on the table. An incumbent doesn't need cold email; they are the destination. A networked founder gets intros. A funded startup invests in content. They have alternatives. They leave.</p> <p>Those without reserves have no exit. First-time founders with no brand, no network, no capital, and no built-in product virality\u00b9\u2070 (most early-stage founders) have nothing to spend. Corporates linger through inertia: teams built, targets set. Recruiters, lead gen agencies, offshore spam shops never leave. They all remain on a path that no longer leads anywhere.</p> <p>The age of permissionless cheap growth is coming to an end.</p> <p>Deadweight Loss</p> <p>But the ones without alternatives keep sending because they have no other path.</p> <p>Volume rises precisely as results collapse. Sending gets cheaper even as response rates crater. The inbox fills faster precisely because the channel is dying.</p> <p>Recipients still pay the attention tax. At least $25 billion worth of attention extracted each year from people who never asked for it. But the commerce that once justified the cost no longer follows. Attention wasted, sales not made: Deadweight loss.</p> <p>Cold email used to be a trade-off. Society grudgingly tolerated the attention tax because the channel provided something in return: a free path to market. The cost was real, the benefit was real.

The incentives set in that moment shaped every outbound tactic that followed. </p> <p>I. The Mill in Maynard</p> <p>The birthplace of spam smelled faintly of wet wool.</p> <p>Digital Equipment Corporation, DEC to insiders, ran its empire from an old mill in Maynard, Massachusetts. Brick walls, long windows, the river just outside. Where spindles once clattered, engineers now argued about logic circuits.</p> <p>DEC was founded in 1957 by two engineers with sharply different temperaments. Ken Olsen was brilliant, stubborn, and famously confident in his forecasts \u2014 including one pronouncement that would come back to haunt him\u00b9. Harlan Anderson, more pragmatic, clashed with Olsen often enough that he left the company in the early 1960s. Together, they transformed a wool mill into the launchpad of the minicomputer revolution.</p> Ken Olsen, DEC's visionary founder, exept when it came to home computers. <p>Their weapon was the PDP line, which shrank the hulking IBM mainframe into something that could sit in a university lab, humming away under fluorescent lights. The PDP-8 in 1965 broke the $20,000 barrier; the PDP-11 went on to train a generation of programmers.</p> <p>By the late 1970s, DEC was the world\u2019s number two computer maker. IBM still wore the suit and tie; DEC showed up in corduroys and a coffee stain. One preached centralization. The other whispered: give the smart people their own machines and see what happens.</p> <p>\u00b9Olsen in 1977: \u201cThere is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.\u201d</p> <p>II. The Next Big Thing</p> <p>But markets move. IBM wasn\u2019t going away, Hewlett-Packard was closing in, and the personal computer loomed like a storm cloud on the horizon. DEC needed another hit.</p> <p>Enter the VAX \u2014 the Virtual Address eXtension line, launched in 1977. These were muscular minicomputers, designed for real workloads.</p> <p>DEC had the machine. What it needed was the stage. And in 1978, the stage was a fledgling network called ARPANET.</p> <p>III. The Network of the Chosen Few</p> <p>In 1969, the U.S. Department of Defense funded a bold experiment: connect research computers across the country so information could move even if parts of the system went down. Four machines went online first: UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah. Resilience was the goal, survival through outages or attacks.</p> <p>What began as a defense project quickly turned academic. By the early \u201970s, ARPANET hosted email, file transfers, even the first awkward stabs at online chat. Membership was tightly controlled: government agencies, universities, research labs. Having an ARPANET account meant you were inside a small, privileged circle trusted by the Pentagon.</p> ARPANET in its formative years: a sparse, elite graph of trust. <p>By 1978, that circle had grown to a few hundred nodes. The users were scientists, grad students, systems managers, defense contractors... the very people who decided which machines their institutions would buy. Logging on conferred status: technically fluent, institutionally powerful, and, coincidentally, DEC\u2019s perfect customer profile.</p> <p>The network wasn\u2019t a marketplace. It was a curated guest list. For a marketer like Gary Thuerk, it looked like destiny.</p> <p>IV. The Father of Spam</p> <p>Gary Thuerk wasn\u2019t an engineer. He studied business at the University of Massachusetts and joined DEC through the marketing track. His job was to move machines, not design them: booking demo halls, organizing roadshows, finding the people who could sign purchase orders.</p> <p>By the mid-1970s he was a young manager in DEC\u2019s Marlboro office, ambitious and audacious. Engineers at DEC often treated marketing as ornamental, but Thuerk believed in the leverage of getting the message right. He wanted to prove that marketing could matter as much as circuitry.</p> <p>By spring 1978, he spotted an opening. ARPANET wasn\u2019t just a research tool; it was a ready-made address book of the very people who decided which minicomputers to buy. One list, hundreds of decision-makers. For Thuerk, it looked less like a network experiment and more like the most efficient invite list he\u2019d ever seen.</p> <p>V. The Day of the Blast</p> <p>On May 3, 1978, Thuerk pulled the trigger. DEC was hosting two events in San Francisco and Los Angeles to unveil the DECSYSTEM-20, a time-sharing descendant of the PDP-10. Instead of dialing phones or licking envelopes, he drafted a single ARPANET message.</p> <p>\u201cWe invite you to a presentation of the new DECsystem-20 family of systems, the most powerful interactive minicomputers in the world\u2026\u201d</p> <p>The invitation went out to 393 recipients. ARPANET\u2019s mail program, never designed for mass lists, buckled under the load. Addresses spilled into the body of the message, creating a messy block of exposed hostnames; a digital equivalent of printing the guest list on the front of the envelope.</p> <p>Embarrassing? Yes. Disqualifying? No. The important part had already happened: the blast had cleared the machine and landed in hundreds of inboxes.</p> <p>VI. Pandemonium</p> <p>The response was swift \u2014 and hostile. ARPANET was funded by the Department of Defense and reserved for research and collaboration. Commercial use broke a shared norm.</p> <p>Administrators erupted. Memos flew. One captured the mood:</p> <p>\u201cThis was a flagrant violation of the ARPANET\u2026 advertising of particular products should be strongly discouraged.\u201d</p> <p>Thuerk\u2019s colleagues bristled as well. In a company where engineering ruled and marketing survived on sufferance, he had committed a cultural felony.</p> <p>His bosses at DEC scolded him. But they didn\u2019t fire him.</p> <p>And that detail is the key. From the very beginning, spam was condemned in public and rewarded in private. Thuerk himself later claimed the blast generated $10\u201314 million in sales. For a single email, that\u2019s a staggering return. Outrage on the surface, results underneath. That dynamic has shaped the industry ever since.</p> <p>VII. The Paradox of the First Spam</p> <p>Forget the caricature of the clueless spammer. Gary Thuerk was a sharpshooter. The product was real. The audience was perfect. The event mattered. And the numbers proved it: millions in revenue flowed from that single unsolicited send.</p> <p>He got the \u201cwho\u201d and the \u201cwhat\u201d exactly right. He just got the \u201cwhere\u201d catastrophically wrong.</p> <p>ARPANET was a members-only club built on trust, not a marketplace open to bids. It was a space for collaboration, and his message was a commercial intrusion. Consent wasn\u2019t just missing; the very idea of it was alien to the network\u2019s culture.</p> <p>This is why the first spam is spam. It\u2019s the original sin of confusing audience with permission. The content was relevant, but the context was violated.</p> Gary Thuerk, the father of spa... e-marketing. <p>VIII. The Legacy</p> <p>History has been less kind than the balance sheet. Gary Thuerk is remembered as the \u201cFather of Spam,\u201d a title he resents. He prefers \u201cthe first e-marketer.\u201d A technically accurate claim, but one that history has emphatically ignored.</p> <p>DEC\u2019s path adds its own irony. The company dominated the 1980s, then missed the personal computer wave. By the late 1990s, Compaq absorbed DEC, and HP later absorbed Compaq. The old mill in Maynard outlived the empire it once housed.</p> <p>Thuerk himself went on to work in marketing and consulting, giving occasional interviews about \u201cthe first spam.\u201d He never stopped insisting that the campaign was smart, targeted, and effective. But he also never escaped the label that history pinned on him.</p> <p>IX. We Follow the Money</p> <p>Spam began as a precise reading of a new medium. A marketer spotted a tight cluster of prospects, fired a single broad message, and proved you could reach thousands with almost no effort. The returns came fast. </p> <p>The lesson arrived just as quickly. When a channel delivers, teams push it until the friction shows. Norms drift, incentives harden, and restraint loses every argument. Thuerk's managers disliked the stunt but kept the results. The industry noticed.</p> <p>From there the pattern spread. Small steps, repeated often, rewired expectations around the inbox. Volume became normal. Attention thinned. What was once correspondence started to feel like clutter. It began in a Massachusetts mill, with a marketer who thought like an engineer, an invitation that seemed harmless, and an inbox that suddenly didn't feel so clean.</p>","tags":["history","sales","spam","ethics","outbound"]},{"location":"posts/the-gospel-of-growth/","title":"The Gospel of Growth","text":"<p>How Predictable Revenue industrialized Sales, and flooded the market with noise</p> <p> From lone-wolf sellers to assembly lines, Aaron Ross\u2019s playbook rewired Silicon Valley\u2019s  growth engines. But the gospel that promised predictability never prepared us for what  happened when the market stopped caring about what the factory produced. </p> <p>I. The World Before the Cloud</p> <p>Before Salesforce, enterprise software was a kingdom ruled by entrenched behemoths like  Oracle and Siebel. Oracle alone pulled in more than $10 billion in annual revenue and  employed over 40,000 people by 2000. Siebel, the CRM king of its era, boasted 8,000  employees and nearly $2 billion in revenue. It was a world of on-premise software, delivered  on CDs and installed on hulking racks of servers that lived in freezing corporate basements.  The price tags were astronomical, often running into the millions, and that was just the  beginning. </p> <p>Buying a CRM from Siebel wasn't like buying a product; it was like commissioning a  cathedral. The process took months, sometimes years. And once the deal was finally signed,  the real pain began. An army of consultants would descend upon your company for the  better part of a year, billing by the hour to customize and implement the behemoth. A year  later, when an upgrade was released, you\u2019d often have to repeat the entire agonizing  process. </p> <p>This was the world Marc Benioff, a former Oracle executive with a showman\u2019s flair, decided  to burn down. His new model, \u201cSoftware as a Service,\u201d was a direct assault on the old order. </p> <p>At Salesforce\u2019s 2000 launch, Benioff wrapped the idea in spectacle. The company staged its  \u201cEnd of Software\u201d campaign with hired actors protesting outside Siebel\u2019s user conference  at Moscone Center. They waved NO SOFTWARE placards and chanted, \u201cThe Internet is  really neat\u2026 software is obsolete!\u201d as Benioff recalled in his book Behind the Cloud. It was  theater meant to show SaaS as a ruthless regime change. </p> <p>Instead of million-dollar upfront fees, it offered a flexible per-seat subscription. Instead of  year-long implementations, you could be up and running in a week. Upgrades, once a  dreaded ritual, now happened automatically, in the background, for free. By the mid-2000s,  Salesforce had redefined how software was built, sold, and used. </p> Salesforce actors, delivering SaaS with maximum cringe. <p>But this new model ran headfirst into a very old problem. The prevailing wisdom for how to  actually sell the stuff was a relic from the age of Siebel. </p> <p>II. The Age of the Artist</p> <p>Before the machine, there was the artist. </p> <p>He was a rare operator, the top enterprise seller of the pre-SaaS era. We\u2019ll call him The  Natural. You know the type, even if you\u2019ve only seen him in movies, or Netflix. The  charismatic lone wolf who operates on instinct and relationships. His tradecraft lived in a  black box: intuition, long lunches, steak dinners. His forecast was a gut feeling. His CRM  was a leather-bound notebook filled with inscrutable scribbles about a client\u2019s daughter\u2019s  graduation. He was magic. He was art. </p> <p>The Natural was perfectly adapted to the world of multi-million-dollar, on-premise deals.  Those deals were marathons: long sales cycles, CIO politics, and relationships cultivated  over years. SaaS as a business model broke that pattern. Contracts were smaller, renewals  more frequent, and growth depended less on a few heroic closers than on a system that  could generate wins week after week. The Natural\u2019s style simply didn\u2019t scale to that world. </p> \u201cGuess what Salesforce\u2019s recruiter said?\u201d <p>III. The Systems Thinker</p> <p>Aaron Ross stepped on the stage in 2002. Trained as an engineer, he had passed through  venture capital, then burned through his own startup as CEO. He wasn\u2019t a natural seller. But  at Salesforce in 2002, he arrived with his own ideas for how to turn prospecting into a  process. </p> <p>The need was urgent. Salesforce\u2019s sales team was drowning in leads, but not in a good way.  Account Executives were doing everything at once: cold outreach, qualification, demos, and  closing. That worked at a tiny scale, but it broke under the sheer volume of leads Salesforce  was starting to generate. In 2002, the year Ross joined, Salesforce booked $22 million in  revenue, up from just $5 million the year before, and the pace was only accelerating. Too  much time vanished chasing unqualified prospects. Deals stalled, pipeline felt unpredictable,  and growth risked bottlenecking on the bandwidth of a few overstretched AEs. </p> <p>What Ross built would later be mythologized as Cold Calling 2.0: an outbound system that  split the sales force into hunters and closers, mechanized pipeline generation, and treated  sales less as art and more as industrial process. A new role, the Sales Development Rep  (SDR), was responsible for one thing only: prospecting and qualifying leads. The qualified  leads went to Account Executives (AEs), the closers who could now focus exclusively on  winning deals. It was a factory line applied to the sales pipeline. </p> <p>The results were undeniable. Within a few years, Ross\u2019s playbook added an extra $100  million in Annual Run Rate. But the real explosion came later, when he left Salesforce,  distilled his learnings into a self-published book in 2011, and gave it a name destined to  become startup scripture: Predictable Revenue. </p> <p>IV. The Gospel Spreads</p> <p>The book landed at exactly the right moment. The SaaS boom was in full swing, and  investors were suddenly obsessed with building repeatable, scalable revenue machines.  Almost overnight, Predictable Revenue became canon. </p> <p>Its magic trick was turning the abstract art of sales into a concrete, measurable  waterfall\u2014the sales funnel. You could now say, with data to back it up: \u201cFor every 100  prospects our SDRs contact, we get 3 meetings. For every 3 meetings our AEs take, we  close 1 deal.\u201d Growth was no longer a mystery. It made growth legible. </p> <p>Founders bought boxes of the book for their sales teams. VCs handed it to their portfolio  CEOs as required reading. Jason Lemkin called it the \u201cSales Bible of Silicon Valley.\u201d The  adoption was staggering. According to surveys by firms like The Bridge Group, by 2015  nearly 70% of high-growth tech companies had adopted the specialized SDR/AE model.  Copying the model felt like de-risking. This new assembly-line approach was becoming the  industry standard. </p> <p>V. The Prophet's Regret</p> <p>But like any gospel, its truth was bent in the retelling. What Ross had pioneered as a smart,  surgical outbound motion began to morph into the flood of cold outreach that would drown  buyers\u2019 inboxes. The average B2B decision-maker, who received perhaps a handful of  prospecting emails a week in the early 2000s, now faces a daily barrage. Recent studies  show reply rates for cold outreach in B2B have slipped into the 1-2% range. If you\u2019ve ever  groaned at yet another bland, semi-personalized outbound message, you\u2019ve lived inside  Ross\u2019s unintended legacy. </p> <p>Ross himself became a kind of reluctant prophet. His follow-up book, 2016\u2019s From  Impossible to Inevitable, can be read as one giant correction to the sins being committed in  his name. The industry had become obsessed with the tactics in his first book while  completely ignoring the foundational strategy. The new book was a massive  course-correction. Its central theme was \u201cNail a Niche,\u201d a plea to focus on a tiny market. It  was a clear warning that said, \u201cYou are all doing it wrong.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s striking to revisit the way Predictable Revenue was originally pitched. The back cover  promised \u201czero cold calls,\u201d described lead generation through \u201cmarketing by teaching,\u201d and  called it \u201ca new kind of sales system.\u201d Ross\u2019s intent was never to flood inboxes with  automation. The gospel was framed as clean, disciplined, even educational. </p> <p>But the market heard something different. \u201cPredictable\u201d became shorthand for volume math,  not strategy. The tactics scaled. The intent was forgotten.  </p> <p>VI. The Legacy of the Machine</p> <p>Predictable Revenue didn\u2019t just shape how companies built go-to-market engines, it also  rewired venture capital\u2019s pattern recognition. For years, partner memos and boardroom  questions centered less on \u201cIs your product great?\u201d and more on \u201cHave you built the  machine?\u201d The presence of a functioning predictable revenue engine became the litmus test  for a Series A investment\u2014a signal that the company was ready to receive capital and pour  it into the top of the funnel. </p> <p>In retrospect, Predictable Revenue belongs to the canon of startup scripture alongside The  Lean Startup and Crossing the Chasm. It offered what founders and VCs crave most: a story  of control over chaos. In a world where revenue had always felt like a black box, Ross  promised a factory blueprint. </p> <p>Two decades later, SaaS founders still talk about \u201cbuilding a predictable revenue engine.\u201d  The book became bigger than its author, and the framework became bigger than the  company it was born in. Salesforce got its $100M boost. Ross got his legacy. And VCs got a  playbook they could bet billions on. </p> <p>The gospel gave sales its factory. But the very efficiency of that model produced buyer fatigue, channel saturation, and a creeping distrust of outreach itself. The age of predictable volume is over. The next one will have to be built on something else entirely.</p> <p>The blueprint of scale taught us how to grow, not what to do when the market stopped caring about what the machine produced.</p>","tags":["sales","history","predictable-revenue","outbound","ethics"]},{"location":"posts/the-red-queen/","title":"The Red Queen","text":"<p>A 40-Year History of the Spam Arms Race</p> <p> The moment email became a way to reach a crowd, the inbox turned into contested ground.

A coevolutionary arms race. \u201cContinuing development,\u201d he wrote in 1973, \u201cis needed just in order to maintain fitness relative to the systems it is co-evolving with.\u201d</p> <p>Carroll himself admired the Dover cliffs on his Channel crossings. He could never have guessed his whimsical queen would end up as one of biology\u2019s most durable metaphors. But here we are.</p> <p>III. The First Bite</p> <p>Fast forward to May 3, 1978.</p> <p>Gary Thuerk, a marketer at Digital Equipment Corporation, decided to announce a product demo. He did it by sending a single message to every ARPANET address he could find on the West Coast\u2014nearly four hundred of them. The network\u2019s mail protocol, never designed for such a blast, promptly choked. The recipient list was so long it overflowed the header and spilled down into the body of the message itself, a clumsy, unavoidable catalog of every person who had just been spammed.</p> <p>In that tight-knit digital ecosystem, the message landed like a bite on unarmored flesh.</p> <p>This was the opening move in a new kind of arms race. The arena had changed from the tidal pool to the inbox, but the Red Queen\u2019s logic was identical: an escalating contest between attack and defense, fought between those seeking attention and those trying to avoid distraction.</p> <p>The prey reacted quickly. ARPA administrators condemned the intrusion, angry memos flew, and rules were drafted to forbid commercial use. Outrage hardened into a cultural shell.</p> <p>But the incentives pointed in a different direction: Thuerk\u2019s bosses publicly scolded him, then, privately, kept him on. The blast was credited with more than $10 million in sales. Etiquette could be bruised; revenue could not. The arms race had its fuel. (For the full story of Thuerk\u2019s infamous message, see The Day of the Blast.)</p> <p>IV. The Deluge</p> <p>Once the payoff was visible, escalation was inevitable. Cultural defenses were brittle; infrastructure offered leverage. The richest seam was the \u201copen relay\u201d: a misconfigured mail server willing to forward anything for anyone. It was as if every post office in the world agreed to deliver any sack of letters, free of charge, no questions asked. Overnight, the cost of sending collapsed toward zero and a single stunt became industrial practice.</p> <p>The first filters arrived soon. They were laughably simple, scanning for banned words like \u201cViagra.\u201d For a moment, it worked.</p> <p>Then \u201cViagra\u201d became \u201cV1agra.\u201d Spammers padded messages with invisible gibberish to dilute the signal and confuse the filters. Each shell provoked a sharper claw.</p> <p>And then the abstract threat acquired a face. In 1994, a husband-and-wife legal team, Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel, posted ads for their immigration law services across thousands of Usenet groups. The pitch was ordinary; the method was not. By blanketing nearly every discussion board, they turned a small ad into a network-wide nuisance. The backlash was instant. Canter and Siegel became the \u201cGreen Card Lawyers,\u201d briefly the most hated people on the internet, and for many this was the moment spam felt less like an annoyance and more like an invasive species.</p> <p>V. Laws and Bayes</p> <p>The ecosystem fought back on two fronts: technical and legal.</p> <p>On the technical front, programmer Paul Graham published A Plan for Spam in 2002. Instead of crude keyword lists, he used probability. A \u201cBayesian filter\u201d would look at the words in an email and estimate the odds it was junk. If a message contained \u201cViagra\u201d and \u201cfree,\u201d the math said spam. If it contained \u201cproject\u201d and \u201cdeadline,\u201d the math said ham. Not perfect, but clever \u2014 a truly adaptive shell.</p> <p>Meanwhile, lawmakers tried to legislate the problem away. The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 sounded decisive. It wasn\u2019t. The law was a clumsy shell, full of holes.</p> <p>Neither defense hold for long.</p> <p>The counter to Bayesian filters was \u201crandom word salad.\u201d Spammers stuffed emails with chunks of legitimate text \u2014 stolen from novels, news stories, even other emails \u2014 to push the probabilities back in their favor. Camouflage by ordinary English.</p> <p>When that faltered, they tried another mutation: image-only spam. The message was no longer text at all, but a JPEG of the ad. A human eye could read it instantly. A Bayesian filter, which only looked at words, saw nothing.</p> <p>VI. Botnets and Blackouts</p> <p>By 2007, spam made up 90% of global email. Not a typo. Ninety percent.</p> <p>Predator move: botnets. Millions of ordinary home computers infected with malware and quietly drafted into a zombie army. Each one looked normal on a desk, but together they became a giant spam factory. The Storm botnet alone may have controlled fifty million machines.</p> <p>Prey response: defenders tried cutting predators off at the source. They built blacklists of known spam servers, unplugged shady internet providers, and coordinated international takedowns.</p> <p>The most dramatic moment came in 2008, when a little-known hosting company in California, McColo, was disconnected from the internet. Security researchers had traced a huge share of global spam traffic back to servers running there. When upstream providers finally pulled the plug, worldwide spam volumes plunged 70% overnight.</p> <p>For a moment it looked like victory.</p> <p>But not for long. The predators rebuilt. Mikko Hypp\u00f6nen of F-Secure summed it up: \u201cEvery time we kill one botnet, another takes its place. It\u2019s like mowing the lawn.\u201d</p> <p>VII. CAPTCHAs and Farms</p> <p>Predator move: after blacklists and ISP takedowns made it risky to run their own servers, spammers pivoted to free webmail. Hotmail, Yahoo, later Gmail \u2014 infinite, disposable sender identities for zero cost, all piggybacking on the good reputation of a mainstream provider. Spin up a thousand accounts, blast, burn them, repeat.</p> <p>Prey response: throttle the factory at the door. Providers put puzzles on the signup page to block automated account creation. CAPTCHAs, those squiggly letters you had to retype, were designed to be trivial for a human eye and maddening for a script. Early bots couldn\u2019t read warped text; the conveyor belt of throwaway accounts slowed.</p> <p>Counter-move: spammers outsourced the eyesight. They tricked users into solving CAPTCHAs (\u201ctype these letters to get your free download\u201d), then built \u201cCAPTCHA farms\u201d where low-wage workers solved puzzles all day, pennies per hundred. Human perception, industrialized.</p> <p>VIII. Filters and Sequencers</p> <p>By the 2010s, brute-force volume stopped working. Google boasted its filters caught 99.9% of spam, and for once the claim was close to true. Behind the scenes, billions of signals fed machine-learning systems: sender reputation, domain age, user behavior, even the subtle rhythm of how emails were written and opened. The old flood tactics drowned under the weight of statistical scrutiny.</p> <p>Predators adapted again. They turned to email warming: sending low volumes of harmless messages from a fresh domain to trick filters into assigning a good reputation, then slowly ramping up volume until the account was \u201ctrusted.\u201d Sequencing tools added another layer, staggering sends and varying wording so that no two recipients saw the same pattern.</p> <p>The effect was to look less like a botnet and more like a salesperson, while still being a botnet at scale. The camouflage worked because it hijacked human instincts. A message that appears timely, personal, and written \u201cjust for you\u201d taps the same reflexes we explored in Parasitic Sales: our tendency to trust the polite knock, to grant attention when approached as individuals. Automation had learned to mimic courtesy.</p> <p>IX. AI vs. AI</p> <p>The arms race has now reached language itself. Large models can generate endless variations of \u201cpersonal\u201d outreach; fluent, polished, and tuned to mimic the quirks of human senders. Every email feels one-off, even when it is one of thousands.</p> <p>Defenders answer in kind. Spam filters are themselves powered by models, scanning for patterns invisible to the human eye: statistical oddities in tone, rhythm, or metadata that betray automation hiding behind a friendly greeting.</p> <p>For the first time, the duel is not just automation dressed as humanity, but two intelligences locked against each other; one creating the illusion of human attention, the other trying to pierce it.</p> <p>This strange predator\u2013prey dance around language is only beginning. It deserves its own story, and I will tell it soon.</p> <p>X. The Hidden Cliffs</p> <p>The history of spam is written in residues. Each message stirs a machine to act, each delivery consumes a thread of bandwidth, each deletion takes a fraction of attention. Insignificant on its own, almost invisible.</p> <p>But what is negligible in isolation becomes immense in the mass. Billions of cycles of wasted computation, terabytes of empty traffic sent beneath the seas, uncounted hours of human focus pulled aside.</p> <p>These layers accumulate as surely as shells pressed into chalk. An unseen sediment of inefficiency builds year after year, a cliff face invisible to the eye yet growing all the same.</p> <p>All that running, only to build a monument to standing still.</p>","tags":["history","sales","spam","arms-race","outbound"]},{"location":"posts/the-screech/","title":"The Screech","text":"<p>How the junk fax wars wrote the rules that govern your inbox</p> <p> Congress banned junk fax in 1991: $500 per violation, enforceable by anyone with a fax machine and a lawyer. Bounty hunters emerged. The biggest fax broadcaster in America was bankrupted. Then the industry quietly rewrote the rules, the model moved to email, and Congress made sure the bounty hunters couldn't follow. </p> <p>I. The Hearing</p> <p>Steve Kirsch was a Silicon Valley engineer who'd made hundreds of millions from Infoseek, one of the first search engines. Kevin Katz was the man behind Fax.com, the largest junk fax operation in the country. On April 13, 2005, one of them sat before a Senate committee. The other didn't bother to show.</p> <p>Two years earlier, the FCC had tightened the rules on junk fax. After a decade of complaints and lawsuits, the federal agency clarified what the TCPA, the 1991 law banning unsolicited fax ads, had always meant: prior express permission was required. No more \"established business relationship\" loophole. Prior written consent, or nothing.</p> <p>The industry pushed back. Trade groups filed petitions. The FCC stayed its own rule, then extended the stay. Now Congress was holding hearings to decide whether the tightening should stand.</p> <p>Kirsch testified with data, charts, and cost-shifting arithmetic. Katz, absent, had his position \"effectively presented through his prior statements and the industry's witnesses.\" The realtors were there. The trade associations were there.</p> <p>Eleven weeks later, George W. Bush signed the Junk Fax Prevention Act. The name was not quite accurate.</p> <p>II. WarGames</p> <p>In the summer of 1983, a movie taught America what a modem could do.</p> <p>WarGames starred Matthew Broderick as a teenager dialing random numbers from his bedroom, hunting for the electronic screech that meant a machine had answered. He was looking for a game company. He found NORAD, the military system that detects incoming nuclear attacks, and nearly started a nuclear war.</p> <p>The technique was real. Hackers called it demon dialing, reconnaissance for open ports. The movie just gave it an ominous new name: war dialing. Programs dialed through the night, logging every number where a modem answered. For years, these programs mostly found mainframes and bulletin boards. But by the late 1980s, the logs started filling up with something else.</p> <p>The environment had changed. Fax machines had been siloed for decades\u2014a Xerox could not talk to a Panasonic\u2014but interoperability had finally arrived, and prices were falling. In 1986, there were still fewer than 200,000 fax machines in America, but by 1989, there were four million. Every dentist, real estate agent, and accountant suddenly had a fax number on their business card. Four million open, unauthenticated ports to the outside world.</p> <p>A massive target waiting for a weapon.</p> <p>In Sunnyvale, an engineer named Hank Magnuski was working on a problem that annoyed him. He hated walking to the fax machine and waiting for confirmation. So he founded GammaLink, and built the first card that let a PC send faxes directly without the need to print a document and feed it manually through the rollers. In 1985, they released it: the GammaFax.</p> <p>It was an innocent invention. But it completed the circuit.</p> <p>The broadcast fax industry was born the moment someone realized these two technologies could be mated. Load a war-dialed list of ten thousand numbers into a PC, point it at Magnuski's card, and walk away. By dawn, rolls of advertisements had unspooled onto mailroom floors across the country.</p> <p>Suddenly, anyone with a PC could pull the trigger. And they did. Dozens of broadcast fax operations sprang up, all of them hammering the same war-dialed lists, all night, every night. By the end of the decade, millions of faxes were being sent every day.</p>      The 1983 Italian release. \"Is it a game or is it reality?\" Unfortunately, the latter.    <p>III. The Backlash</p> <p>You'd leave the office Friday evening, fax machine's dim light visible in the dark. By Monday, the roll had advanced ten pages. The cartridge you replaced last week was lighter. Paper curled on the floor, some still warm. Ads for cheaper long-distance rates, toner cartridges at wholesale prices, a seminar in Tampa that would change your life.</p> <p>One office worker famously taped four sheets of paper into a loop, wrote \"DO NOT FAX US AGAIN,\" and fed it back at 3 AM, letting the machine run until the spammer's roll was gone.</p> <p>Most people tried the polite route: every junk fax included a removal number, a promise that one call would make it stop. The number was often a trap. Calling confirmed your line was live, moved you from the junk list to the gold list, and tripled the faxes.</p> <p>By 1991, the frustration had reached Capitol Hill. Representative Ed Markey of Massachusetts led the charge, framing the issue as a \"property violation.\" The fax machine was a private printing press, he argued, that advertisers were commandeering to print their own flyers. The Congressional findings were explicit: junk fax involved \"cost shifting\", a textbook negative externality. The advertiser derived the benefit; the recipient paid for the paper, the ink, and the wear on the machine.</p> <p>Congress passed the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, signed by George H.W. Bush (the father) on December 20, 1991. Among its provisions: a flat ban on unsolicited fax advertisements.</p> <p>The penalties were designed to bite. Five hundred dollars per violation, trebled to $1,500 for willful violations. Then, the hinge. A private right of action. You didn't have to wait for the government to sue. You could do it yourself.</p> <p>The lawsuits, however, didn't come right away. The industry challenged the ban on First Amendment grounds, arguing that commercial faxes were protected speech. For years, enforcement stalled while courts deliberated.</p> <p>By 1995, the courts had ruled: the TCPA was constitutional. The Ninth Circuit validated the ban. The Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal.</p> <p>IV. The Hunt</p> <p>The $500 penalty created an industry.</p> <p>Sam Nicholson was a Georgia attorney with a one-man office. Junk faxes for a Hooters restaurant kept arriving. He kept them. Then he looked up the law. In Lawyer's Weekly, he found what most recipients had missed: the TCPA let you sue on your own behalf. In 1995, he filed a class action.</p> <p>It took six years to reach a jury. Hooters fought on every front: challenging the private right of action, disputing jurisdiction, contesting class certification. In March 2001, the jury found willful violations and awarded roughly $12 million in statutory damages. The lawyers took $4 million. Hooters of Augusta filed for bankruptcy.</p> <p>The verdict revealed the math. Hooters had assets. Hooters had a brand to protect. Hooters couldn't disappear. That's why they paid.</p> <p>The Dallas Cowboys learned the same lesson. In 2001, the team settled a junk fax class action for $1.73 million. The faxes had pitched game tickets to 125,000 business fax machines.</p> <p>The cases attracted imitators and opportunists. Office managers started collecting junk faxes in shoeboxes, waiting until they had fifty or a hundred, then filing suit. Walk out with a $25,000 settlement. They treated the fax machine as a printing press for bounties.</p> <p>That logic pointed suits toward defendants who could pay. The advertisers had assets. The fax broadcasters had shell companies, disposable corporate names, offshore accounts, nothing to seize.</p> <p>Liability followed the advertiser, not the broadcaster. Kevin Katz built his business around that fact.</p> <p>V. The Hustler</p> <p>Little is known about Katz before Fax.com.</p> <p>He surfaces in the record fully formed: a man with what one reporter described as a South African accent, living south of Los Angeles, incorporating a company called Fax.com in June 1998. Another noted he had previously sold exercise equipment. That's it. No verified photograph of him appears to survive online. He exists in the archive as just a name in court filings and the quotes he gave to reporters who came calling.</p> <p>Fax.com began broadcasting on October 1, 1998. By 2000, revenues hit $9 million. By 2002, $20 million. At its peak, Fax.com sent three million faxes a day. The company boasted of owning \"the largest fax number database in the world.\"</p> <p>Katz didn't hide. He gave interviews to the Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times with the air of a man who had discovered a loophole in physics. \"Many of our clients don\u2019t have access to traditional forms of advertising,\" he explained. \"Fax enables them to compete with larger, more established companies.\"</p> <p>Those clients were the key to his insulation: travel agents, mortgage brokers, roofers. Unlike Hooters or the Cowboys, they were small operators with few assets to seize. Private lawyers chased deep pockets elsewhere. Katz faced little immediate pressure. Only a federal agency could aim at the source, and federal enforcement moved slowly.</p> <p>When challenged, Katz had a worldview ready. The recipients? They had to prove they didn't want it. \"You can't tell me that no one in those offices didn't ask for it,\" he told the Washington Post. \"We send out terrific deals\u2014vacations, cell phones. Sometimes people do request it.\" The accusers? Parasites. \"Pretty pathetic that a company that size has nothing better to do than to sue us and to leech off our clients.\" His own compliance officer floated a theory: law firms were deliberately placing their fax numbers in Fax.com's database to manufacture lawsuits.</p> <p>And the harm itself? \"What was the harm?\" Katz scoffed. \"Someone got a piece of paper?\"</p> <p>When regulators finally came calling, he had a constitutional defense ready. In August 2002, he issued a press release citing a Missouri court ruling that the fax ban \"unnecessarily violates First Amendment rights.\" Commercial speech, he argued. Protected expression. His attorney called the TCPA \"a clear infringement on commercial speech rights\" and predicted it would be overturned. The Eighth Circuit reversed the Missouri ruling within months. Katz kept faxing.</p> <p>His real strategy was structural. Every time a fine or injunction landed, Fax.com would vanish, only to be replaced by Lighthouse Marketing or Impact Media or Get-Away Publications the following morning. By the time a judge signed an order, Katz had moved the desks, and changed the name on the door. In a December 2003 deposition, he claimed he didn't know he was CEO of Fax.com until his own lawyer reminded him.</p> <p>The evasion extended to the money. Katz routed revenues through a maze of bank accounts, trusts, and offshore corporations. When regulators issued fines, Fax.com simply refused to pay. When Covington &amp; Burling, a major D.C. law firm, won a $2.3 million judgment for the barrage of faxes sent to its offices, they never collected a penny. \"What's done is done,\" Katz said. \"The bottom line is, they aren't going to get anything out of me. All they'll do is run up legal fees.\"</p> <p>VI. The Engineer</p> <p>Steve Kirsch had made his fortune co-founding Infoseek, one of the first search engines, sold to Disney in 1999. By 2002 he was CEO of Propel Software in San Jose. He had time. He had money. And his fax machine had just printed the same credit-repair ad twice in one morning.</p> <p>\"It really pissed me off,\" he later said. He started counting. Over a thousand junk faxes a year on his home machine. Late-night wake-ups from autodialers beeping through the dark.</p> <p>When he traced the source, every fax led back to the same place: Fax.com.</p> <p>Kirsch was an engineer by temperament. He believed that if you could measure a problem precisely enough, you could solve it. He looked at Katz's operation and saw a math problem: the cost of sending a fax was nearly zero, but the cost of receiving one was real. Paper, toner, machine wear, tied-up phone lines. \"These people have no right to demand the paper and ink I pay for,\" he said. The economics were broken. The sender captured the benefit; the recipient bore the burden.</p>      So familiar. Have we met? (Source: 2002 Junk Faxes Collection, Internet Archive)    <p>\"If someone was already doing something about this, I wouldn't bother,\" he said. \"So I decided to devote some time to stopping it.\"</p> <p>He built junkfax.org as a central intelligence hub: call-trap data, John Doe identities, litigation strategies. Anyone with a lawyer could join the hunt. He wasn't interested in the small fry. He wanted the source. And Katz made himself easy to find. While other broadcasters hid behind shell companies, Katz gave interviews. He was the biggest and loudest operator, a brute who acted like no one could touch him.</p> <p>VII. The Showdown</p> <p>Kirsch tested Katz with a personal offer: $1 million of his own money to stop sending faxes to people who didn't want them.</p> <p>Katz turned him down.</p> <p>The law, theoretically, had a fix. Kirsch did the arithmetic. Millions of faxes, $500 each, trebled for willful violation. In August 2002, Kirsch filed a class action seeking $2.2 trillion in damages. The number was larger than the GDP of France. Kirsch wasn't trying to collect. He was trying to make Katz's existence as a business mathematically impossible. Katz called it \"unfounded and absurd.\"</p> <p>The two men never shared a room. Their war played out in press releases, court filings, depositions. Kirsch called Fax.com \"the most hated company in America.\" Katz called Kirsch's crusade \"litigation terrorism\" by a billionaire with too much time.</p> <p>Katz's lawyers knew how to buy time. As one attorney who sued Fax.com later testified to Congress, \"It became clear very quickly that Fax.com was very skilled at using the legal system to draw out\" litigation. When Covington &amp; Burling, a major D.C. law firm, demanded Fax.com stop faxing their offices, the company didn't stop. It sent 1,634 faxes in a single week.</p> <p>After a federal court finally issued an injunction in October 2004, Kirsch told reporters: \"I'll wait and see if it stops Fax.com's faxing. But if it doesn't, someone is going to spend some time in jail.\"</p> <p>VIII. The Reckoning</p> <p>The walls closed in from every direction.</p> <p>At the University of Washington Medical Center, Fax.com's servers were so aggressive they tied up every incoming line. Doctors couldn't receive lab results or patient charts because the lines were constantly seized by ads for $199 cruises. The state of Washington settled after Fax.com admitted to blast-faxing thousands of patients.</p> <p>In August 2002, the FCC proposed a $5.4 million fine against Fax.com\u2014the largest in TCPA history. The commission cited a \"pattern of deception to conceal its involvement\" and \"utter disregard for the law.\" Kirsch had provided much of the intelligence that made it possible.</p> <p>In July 2003, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer filed a $15 million lawsuit. The complaint named Fax.com, Katz, and his chief technical officer. It accused them of violating state consumer protection laws and running an illegal operation that \"shifts the printing costs of advertisements to the recipients.\"</p> <p>In October 2004, a federal court issued an injunction shutting down Fax.com and five \"surrogate\" successor entities: Lighthouse Marketing, Impact Media, and the rest of Katz's shell game. The judge had seen through the corporate structure.</p> <p>For a moment, it looked like the hunters had won. The fines were issued, the injunctions were signed, and Katz was cornered. But the industry was already looking past the courtroom.</p> <p>IX. The Heist</p> <p>In December 2003, Congress passed CAN-SPAM. The name stood for \"Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act,\" but the law didn't control much. It didn't ban unsolicited email. It legalized it, provided you included an opt-out link and accurate headers.</p> <p>The shift was philosophical. The TCPA had treated unsolicited faxes as illegal by default: you needed permission before you sent. CAN-SPAM flipped the logic: unsolicited email was legal by default, as long as you let people escape afterward. Opt-in became opt-out.</p> <p>Critically, CAN-SPAM excluded any private right of action. Only the FTC and state attorneys general could sue; individual recipients had no standing. Congress had watched the TCPA litigation explosion: the class actions, the $12 million verdicts, Kirsch's trillion-dollar crusade. The industry's lobbyists pointed to the Hooters case and called it lawsuit abuse, warning of a litigation tsunami. Congress chose to avoid it.</p> <p>CAN-SPAM did something else: it preempted state law. Before 2003, states could pass their own anti-spam statutes, and some were considering laws with real teeth, including private rights of action. The industry won the federal fight and foreclosed every other battlefield.</p> <p>That was email. Then they came back for fax.</p> <p>In July 2003, the FCC had tried to tighten the TCPA\u2014eliminating the \"established business relationship\" loophole, requiring written consent. The Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, the Newspaper Association of America, and dozens of trade groups petitioned for reconsideration. The FCC stayed its own rules. Then extended the stay. Then extended it again.</p> <p>On June 28, 2005, the House took up the Junk Fax Prevention Act. The act didn't strengthen the TCPA. It aligned fax with the CAN-SPAM philosophy: opt-out, not opt-in. The Junk Fax Prevention Act didn't prevent junk fax. It prevented the FCC from stopping it.</p> <p>Eleven weeks. That's how long it took from Kirsch's testimony to George W. Bush (the son) signing the bill into law. The courts had taken a decade to validate the junk fax ban. The bounty hunters had taken years to build their cases. The industry took eleven weeks to rewrite the rules, in a half-empty chamber, by voice vote, with no debate.</p> <p>Ed Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who had authored the original TCPA in 1991, signed onto the bill.</p> <p>X. \u201cWhat\u2019s the harm?\u201d</p> <p>By 2004, Fax.com was shut down by federal injunction, the operation dismantled in court. The $5.4 million fine was never paid, and Katz faded into obscurity. Kirsch eventually became a prominent critic of COVID-19 vaccines, applying the same methods\u2014data analysis, public campaigns, litigation\u2014to a target that made him a very different kind of polarizing figure. Same engineer, different war.</p> <p>Kirsch got his injunction, but when Congress passed CAN-SPAM in 2003, they essentially codified Kevin Katz\u2019s world view. The TCPA said ask first. CAN-SPAM, just like Katz: apologize later. And by stripping email of the private right of action, the very weapon Kirsch had wielded so effectively, Congress ensured there would be no bounty hunters in the digital age.</p> <p>Fear drove the law, but the spirit of the times defined it. The internet was the future, and the future had to be protected from regulators who didn't understand it. The Bush administration was pro-business, skeptical of restrictions. Digital felt cleaner than analog, self-correcting, frictionless. Email had no screech, paper or toner cost\u2014the burden was invisible, so it was easy to pretend it didn't exist. Opt-out felt modern. Opt-in felt paternalistic, a relic of the fax era.</p> <p>The $500 fax penalty remains on the books, a zombie statute that trade groups still drag to the Supreme Court every few years. The argument is the same one they made in 1991, the same one Katz made in 2002: the ban is an unconstitutional restriction on commercial speech. They tried to kill it in Barr (2020), and they tried again in McLaughlin (2025).</p> <p>But they are fighting over a corpse. The model has moved on. The physical cost of paper and toner didn't just annoy the recipient; it made the cost shifting tangible, creating an externality the law could see and price. The internet made the cost invisible, and the law looked the other way.</p> <p>Katz lost his company. But his business model is sitting in your inbox, unpunished and infinite.</p>","tags":["outbound","spam","regulation","attention","externalities"]}]}
