For now, it\u2019s a set of reflections, curious to see where they lead. </p>"},{"location":"posts/degrees-of-clean/","title":"Degrees of Clean","text":"<p>Why Clean Sales is a ladder, not a switch \u2014 and how to climb it</p> <p>Published: August 18, 2025</p> <p>In Outbound is Dirty, I compared conventional outbound sales to a poorly regulated factory: profitable for the operator, costly for everyone else. The costs take the form of an attention tax, minutes of focus taken from unwilling recipients of poorly targeted emails. These recipients are, in effect, subsidising the sender\u2019s business.</p> <p>I cast the problem as a binary: your outbound is either \u201cdirty\u201d or \u201cclean.\u201d It was a convenient simplification, but reality is less tidy. Cleanliness is not a switch you flip. It is a ladder you climb, one rung or one step at a time. Some systems burn dirtier than others. The intelligent goal is not to reach some mythical top rung of perfect cleanliness, which would perhaps mean no selling at all. The goal is to keep climbing toward cleaner operation.</p> <p>You can see the same pattern in energy generation. At the bottom step: wood fires, leaving soot on walls, clothes, and lungs. We climbed to coal: cleaner and more efficient than wood, but whole cities still wore a permanent gray coat. Then came natural gas: cleaner still, producing more heat per unit and at a lower cost, though still a fossil fuel with significant emissions, methane leakage during extraction, and reliance on finite reserves. Now we climb toward solar. Not perfect; it uses land, requires manufacturing, and recycling panels is a challenge. Yet it is vastly cleaner than anything below it and, in many cases, already cheaper.</p> <p>Moving up the ladder usually means a better balance of cost and cleanliness. Some shifts are obvious. Solar beats coal on both measures. Others are harder to call. Old fuels can linger through habit, inertia, and sunk costs, even when cleaner, cheaper options exist.</p> <p>Sales has its own version of the ladder. The bottom steps are mass-blast, low-precision, low-value tactics. Higher up are systems that aim precisely, deliver genuine value per touch, and know when to stop. They are cleaner and they work better. Yet, as in energy, the lower steps still dominate the grid.</p> <p>Why Bother Climbing</p> <p>One reason to climb is sustainability.</p> <p>Hannah Ritchie, in Not the End of the World, defines it as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. For most of history, we failed at the first part: we could not meet our own needs. Now we can. But we do it by consuming the very systems that future generations will rely on.</p> <p>Sales faces the same structural flaw. A company can meet this quarter\u2019s target through mass outreach, misaligned pitches, and brute-force persistence. The tactic works, but only by degrading the channel itself \u2014 burning trust, lowering response rates, and making the next prospect that much harder to reach. It\u2019s the sales equivalent of strip-mining: the numbers look great today, but you\u2019re standing in a field of churned mud wondering where the next vein is.</p> <p>Ritchie\u2019s argument is that our generation is the first with the means to break this pattern. The parallel in sales is exact. We have the measurement to see the damage, and the tools to reduce it without reducing results. The question is no longer whether it can be done, but whether we choose to keep digging holes or start building something that lasts. (Spoiler alert: AI will help.)</p> <p>Ways of Being Clean</p> <p>Cleanliness isn\u2019t binary, and it isn\u2019t measured in only one way.</p> <p>In energy, cleanliness is measured on several axes: carbon emissions, land use, deaths per terawatt-hour, toxic waste. Each is a separate measure of harm. Progress means reducing the impact on each axis, even if none can be brought to zero.</p> <p>Sales has its own axes of cleanliness. Dirty systems impose the highest attention cost \u2014 consuming large amounts of human focus for little useful return. The goal is to meet sales targets while lowering that cost. Greater precision in targeting. Higher density of value in every contact. Messages that are clear. An approach that is honest and respectful. Improving on these dimensions reduces the cost imposed on the market and makes results more durable.</p> <p>Precision: Aim Before You Fire</p> <p>Dirty sales systems spray attention costs across people who were never going to buy. Precision reduces that waste.</p> <p>I recently spoke with a sales rep selling an outbound tool. He proudly told me it delivered \u201cindustry-beating\u201d reply rates of 5%. For every 5 people who responded, there were 95 who would rather not have received the email at all. That\u2019s considered best in class.</p> <p>The fix isn\u2019t just \u201cbetter lists.\u201d It\u2019s understanding why a prospect might be in-market now. In sales tech, this gets lumped under \u201cintent signals,\u201d but not all intent is equal. True intent is direct evidence of active interest or relevant need: a public statement from the buyer, a job posting that signals a capability gap, a technology change you know creates pain you can solve.</p> <p>What often gets sold as \u201cintent\u201d is far weaker: someone at the company read a vaguely related article, or a contact clicked on a link in a generic newsletter. Those can help with prioritisation, but they\u2019re not reasons to reach out. When your definition of intent is loose, you end up creating noise that drowns out the signal.</p> <p>Precision means reserving the interruption for when you have a specific, time-sensitive reason to believe you can help. Every touch still spends attention, but when you fire only on true intent, the cost is far more likely to generate value \u2014 for you and for the buyer.</p> <p>Value Density: Paying Back Attention</p> <p>Once you\u2019ve aimed correctly, the interaction must be worth the prospect\u2019s time. Value Density is the ratio of insight delivered to attention consumed. In a clean system, that ratio is always in focus.</p> <p>Consider a discovery call. In the low-density version, the seller works through a script. The buyer answers questions, the clock runs out, and they leave knowing nothing new. Thirty minutes gone \u2014 a pure attention tax.</p> <p>In the high-density version, the seller arrives with context. They share observations from similar companies, highlight a risk the buyer hasn\u2019t considered, suggest a quick check the team can run, or link a recent move to a likely consequence. The buyer leaves better informed, whether or not they are a fit.</p> <p>Both calls meet the seller\u2019s need for qualification. Only one repays the attention it costs.</p> <p>Clarity: Don\u2019t Make Them Pay Twice</p> <p>Every message already costs attention. If it\u2019s unclear, you add a second toll, the mental effort to figure out what you meant.</p> <p>That second toll is rarely obvious, but the reader feels it. It\u2019s that moment when they have to stop, re-read, and piece together your point. Even if they get there, you\u2019ve made them work for something they didn\u2019t ask for in the first place.</p> <p>The empathetic move is to carry that burden yourself. Use their vocabulary, put the point first, make the next step obvious.</p> <p>Honesty</p> <p>The fake email thread. Subject line starts with \u201cRE:\u201d to look like you\u2019re replying to something they sent. You\u2019re not. There\u2019s no prior exchange.</p> <p>Sadly, it works. Opens go up. Some people stay oblivious and a few even convert. But seriously \u2014 how do you look at yourself in the mirror?</p> <p>Respect: Knowing When to Stop</p> <p>No is no. It goes \u2014 should go \u2014 without saying. But if the prospect has to say it out loud, you weren\u2019t listening.</p> <p>If you want to see how deep the madness runs, Google \u201cideal number of touches in an email sequence\u00b9.\u201d You\u2019ll find entire articles explaining why the \u201csweet spot\u201d is somewhere between five and eight touches. Fewer than that and you\u2019re \u201cgiving up too early.\u201d Most replies, we\u2019re told, come from later touches. That might be optimal if your only metric is overall reply rate. It\u2019s far less optimal if you care about the attention tax you impose on society, let alone reputational costs.</p> <p>I think even three is pushing it, even when I\u2019m convinced the person would benefit from hearing from me. Every time an email is ignored is another clue the recipient doesn\u2019t give a shit \u2014 so why keep pressing?</p> <p>\u00b9 There\u2019s a whole industry of tools that will happily automate this for you \u2014 which is basically adding insult to injury, because the sender isn\u2019t even taking the time to notice, let alone care, that you\u2019re not interested.</p> <p>The Work</p> <p>If climbing this ladder feels like a lot of work, that\u2019s because it is.</p> <p>Dirty sales is easy. It\u2019s the path of least resistance \u2014 a system optimised for the sender\u2019s convenience. A numbers game played with other people\u2019s time.</p> <p>Clean sales is harder. It asks for thought, discipline, and real effort. But that effort isn\u2019t a cost; it\u2019s a signal. It says you respect the person on the other end. That you see them as a potential partner, not just an entry in your CRM. It is, in short, an act of empathy.</p> <p>And the work pays. The return isn\u2019t just feeling good about yourself; it\u2019s a business that lasts. Sustainable results. A brand that survives the next quarter. A profession that pulls in great people instead of chewing them up.</p> <p>The lazy path will always be there, waiting. The better one won\u2019t build itself.</p> <p>(Alright, technically AI can do some of the heavy lifting.

But it doesn't have to be.</p> <p>Published: August 7, 2025</p> <p>Sales, as a human occupation, is essential and fundamentally good. At its core, sales is about helping people discover, understand, and ultimately buy the products or solutions a company offers. The very fact that customers willingly complete these transactions is proof enough that these products deliver real value. Seen this way, sales acts as a lubricant, a catalyst: it shortens the gap between potential value\u2014the promise of what the product could do\u2014and realized value, which the customer experiences once they purchase and use it.</p> <p>The world simply cannot function without sales.</p> <p>And yet, sales often ends up dirty, and cold outbound sales is particularly so. It generates pollution in the same way a chemical plant produces waste. To manufacture a profitable compound, the factory inevitably creates byproducts. When that waste is discharged into a river, the cost isn\u2019t borne by the factory but passed downstream to communities living beside it.</p> <p>Economists call this a negative externality: a cost imposed on third parties who neither chose nor benefit from the transaction.</p> <p>Noise pollution is another example. A nightclub generates profit for its owners and entertainment for its customers, while neighbors\u2014who didn\u2019t vote for any of it\u2014lie awake at 3 AM, robbed of sleep and peace of mind. Worse still, as they stare at the ceiling, they can\u2019t help but picture the club owner raising a glass to a successful night.</p> <p>Outbound sales creates similar negative externalities, ones I\u2019ve always found hard to ignore when building sales operations. The pollution isn\u2019t audible like noise or visible like waste, but it\u2019s just as real. It appears as overflowing inboxes, interrupted conversations, and minutes stolen from our concentration. Individually, these costs seem trivial. But multiplied millions of times, they become a burden carried by society\u2014imposed without consent or consultation, like those neighbors kept up by the nightclub.</p> <p>Companies evaluate outbound programs using familiar metrics: the volume of outreach (emails, calls), conversion rates into qualified leads, and the percentage of those leads that become paying customers. Success is declared when the total value of closed deals exceeds the cost of running the program.</p> <p>Those costs are typically calculated as the sum of data acquisition and validation, sales tooling (CRM, sequencing software, automation), outreach efforts (calls, emails, meetings), sales team compensation, marketing collateral, and, to a lesser extent, overhead like compliance and operations.</p> <p>What\u2019s never tallied in this equation are the costs outbound pushes onto everyone else. But if they were factored in\u2014using the same cold numerical logic we apply to leads, deals, and returns\u2014outbound might be designed very differently.</p> <p>There\u2019s another dynamic at play in cold outbound, one that mirrors a well-known dilemma from environmental science.</p> <p>The tragedy of the commons, a concept popularized by ecologist Garrett Hardin in the 1960s, describes how shared resources tend to be overused when individuals act in their own immediate self-interest. In Hardin\u2019s example, several shepherds graze animals on a common pasture; each benefits by adding more livestock, but the damage from overgrazing is shared by all. Eventually, the resource collapses\u2014and everyone loses.</p> <p>Sales faces a similar dynamic. The common pasture is customer attention. These are people who might genuinely benefit from our product, if we could just hold their interest for a few minutes. But that same customer lives in a swarm of competing offers, each salesperson acting rationally by sending one more email, making one more call, leaving one more message.</p> <p>The result: an ecosystem choking on excess. Attention\u2014once relatively abundant\u2014has become scarce, expensive, and increasingly immune to capture, another casualty of a system that generates value by offloading its costs on time, focus, and consent at massive scale.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.</p> <p>The assumption that waste is an unavoidable byproduct of sales isn\u2019t a law of nature. It\u2019s a consequence of how we choose to operate: how we build teams, run programs, and measure success.</p> <p>So: is it possible to build a truly Clean Outbound?</p> <p>That\u2019s the question I explore on these pages: whether outbound programs can be reimagined to drastically reduce the negative externalities we\u2019ve come to accept as normal\u2014and, just as critically, whether they can match or even outperform the effectiveness of the conventional, \u201cdirty\u201d systems that dominate today.</p> <p>Because unless it delivers real results, Clean Outbound is just another elegant theory collecting dust.</p>","tags":["sales","ethics","outbound","externalities","attention","systems"]},{"location":"posts/parasitic-sales/","title":"Parasitic Sales","text":"<p>How companies hijack your instincts to keep you on the line</p> <p>Published: August 11, 2025</p> <p>A visitor in the nest</p> <p>The cuckoo watches from a hidden perch, waiting for the warbler to leave its nest. As soon as the coast is clear, she flies in, lays her egg in seconds, and takes off, often carrying away one of the originals to keep the number the same.</p> <p>Soon after, the warbler returns. Inside are eggs that look exactly like hers. She settles in, warming them without the slightest suspicion.</p> <p>The match is so close the warbler does not notice the intrusion. That cuckoo egg hatches earlier than the rest, revealing a chick already larger and stronger. Within days, it pushes the other eggs, her own offspring, out of the nest entirely.</p> <p>She continues to feed it because the cuckoo chick has evolved to trigger her parental instincts with ruthless precision. The colour of its gape, the pitch of its begging call, and the timing of its hunger are tuned to match or outcompete her own young. Evolutionary biologists call this brood parasitism, the exploitation of one species\u2019 instincts by another.</p>      The cuckoo in the nest \u2014 nature\u2019s original cold caller.    <p>Richard Dawkins, in The Selfish Gene, uses the cuckoo as a vivid example of how natural selection favours strategies that exploit pre-wired behaviours. What\u2019s striking is not that the warbler loses, but that it loses by doing exactly what it has evolved to do. The cuckoo does not need speed or force. It wins by presenting the right signals in the right sequence and letting instinct carry out the rest.</p> <p>The deception works because it targets instincts that cannot be switched off. Even when the truth is obvious, the impulse to feed still wins \u2014 much like picking up the phone out of habit when an unfamiliar number flashes on the screen.</p> <p>Our own wiring</p> <p>We like to think of ourselves as different from the warbler. After all, we\u2019ve got consciousness, reasoning, choice. Surely that protects us from being manipulated by a beak and some chirping.</p> <p>But we also run on instincts \u2014 survival mechanisms shaped over hundreds of thousands of years in an environment where living in a group was the difference between life and death. Politeness, reciprocity, and conflict avoidance weren\u2019t \u201cnice-to-haves.\u201d They were survival code. In small, tightly knit groups, returning a favour kept you in good standing. Avoiding unnecessary conflict meant fewer injuries and stronger cooperation when hunting or defending the group. Responding when addressed signalled awareness and respect, reinforcing bonds that might one day save your life.</p> <p>Over many generations, these behaviours became second nature, reinforced by the survival advantages they brought in the ancestral environment. Those same reflexes now operate in a world of call queues, unknown numbers, and scripted pitches. And like the warbler\u2019s feeding reflex, they can be triggered by the right cues, whether or not the source is genuine.</p> <p>The phone rings</p> <p>Your phone rings. The number\u2019s unfamiliar.</p> <p>You could ignore it, but curiosity, another ancient instinct, taps you on the shoulder. You pick up. The voice on the other end is warm, confident, friendly. They use your name. They ask how you are, and you answer automatically, even though you\u2019ve never met. Only a few seconds in do you realise this is the electricity company, the one that calls every few months with a \u201cspecial rate\u201d that somehow always turns out higher than the one you have now.</p> <p>There\u2019s a shift: part irritation, part guilt. You want to hang up. You also don\u2019t want to be rude. It\u2019s a small but effective trap. You know you don\u2019t want what they\u2019re offering \u2014 yet the polite thing to do, the instinctive thing, is to hear them out.</p> <p>A fine-tuned system</p> <p>The only thing that matters to the people running it is conversion. And conversion goes up when you stay on the line. Whether it\u2019s because the person in charge of outbound is consciously borrowing from the cunning of the cuckoo, or simply the cumulative result of decades of trial and error in call centres (just like biological evolution), we\u2019ve ended up with a system that essentially hijacks your social instincts.</p> <p>The friendly opening. The first-name greeting. The pace and tone of the voice. Each detail tested, refined, and sharpened until it tugs at your wiring just enough to keep you from hanging up.</p> <p>What I find most irritating is that the people who sign off on these tactics will never face you. They don\u2019t hear the sigh in your voice or feel the tension of staying polite while someone burns your time. That part is outsourced to the people on the phones, often underpaid, under pressure, and not to blame for the strategy they\u2019re carrying out.</p> <p>Your frustration has nowhere to go. You hang up, but the system remains untouched. And each call makes you fractionally quicker to cut the next one short.</p> <p>The numbers</p> <p>In Q1 2025, consumers in North America and Europe were hit with 12.5 billion spam and fraud calls; about 137 million a day. Spam now makes up 44 % of unidentified calls in France, 42 % in Spain, and 22 % in the U.S. (Hiya, Q1 2025; Q3 2023).</p> <p>So it\u2019s no surprise that 94 % of European consumers believe unidentified calls are likely spam or fraudulent (Hiya/GSMA, 2022). The share of adults who usually answer unknown numbers has collapsed over the last decade \u2014 to 19 % in the U.S. (Pew, 2020) and 28 % in the UK (YouGov, 2022) \u2014 and the real surprise is that those figures aren\u2019t even lower.</p> <p>Each unwanted call trains us to be quicker to hang up\u2014or never pick up\u2014on the next one. The damage compounds, and over time answer rates fall and conversion follows. No amount of brand spend buys that back. The irony is that companies can spend millions polishing their brand and, in the same quarter, grind it down with tactics that make people less likely to ever pick up again.</p> <p>Just hang up the phone</p> <p>If a reed warbler could suddenly understand the cuckoo\u2019s trick, it wouldn\u2019t hesitate. It would shove the cuckoo chick over the edge the moment it recognised the threat.</p> <p>The chick itself isn\u2019t the villain, but it\u2019s still part of a parasitic system. Same with the voice on the line: they\u2019re just the visible part of a machine built to drain your time for someone else\u2019s gain.</p> <p>Once you spot the pattern, hanging up is not only perfectly reasonable \u2014 it\u2019s an act of self-protection. Your attention and goodwill are finite, and the system is designed to spend them. You\u2019re under no obligation to feed it.</p>","tags":["ethics","sales","outreach","behavioural-science"]},{"location":"posts/the-day-of-the-blast/","title":"The Day of the Blast","text":"<p>How the first mass email created outbound\u2019s original sin</p> <p>Published: September 4, 2025</p> <p>I. The Mill in Maynard</p> <p>The birthplace of spam smelled faintly of wet wool.</p> <p>Digital Equipment Corporation, DEC to insiders, ran its empire from an old mill in Maynard, Massachusetts. Brick walls, long windows, the river just outside. Where spindles once clattered, engineers now argued about logic circuits.</p> <p>DEC was founded in 1957 by two engineers with sharply different temperaments. Ken Olsen was brilliant, stubborn, and famously confident in his forecasts \u2014 including one pronouncement that would come back to haunt him\u00b9. Harlan Anderson, more pragmatic, clashed with Olsen often enough that he left the company in the early 1960s. Together, they transformed a wool mill into the launchpad of the minicomputer revolution.</p> Ken Olsen, DEC's visionary founder, exept when it came to home computers. <p>Their weapon was the PDP line, which shrank the hulking IBM mainframe into something that could sit in a university lab, humming away under fluorescent lights. The PDP-8 in 1965 broke the $20,000 barrier; the PDP-11 went on to train a generation of programmers.</p> <p>By the late 1970s, DEC was the world\u2019s number two computer maker. IBM still wore the suit and tie; DEC showed up in corduroys and a coffee stain. One preached centralization. The other whispered: give the smart people their own machines and see what happens.</p> <p>\u00b9Olsen in 1977: \u201cThere is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.\u201d</p> <p>II. The Next Big Thing</p> <p>But markets move. IBM wasn\u2019t going away, Hewlett-Packard was closing in, and the personal computer loomed like a storm cloud on the horizon. DEC needed another hit.</p> <p>Enter the VAX \u2014 the Virtual Address eXtension line, launched in 1977. These were muscular minicomputers, designed for real workloads.</p> <p>DEC had the machine. What it needed was the stage. And in 1978, the stage was a fledgling network called ARPANET.</p> <p>III. The Network of the Chosen Few</p> <p>In 1969, the U.S. Department of Defense funded a bold experiment: connect research computers across the country so information could move even if parts of the system went down. Four machines went online first: UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah. Resilience was the goal, survival through outages or attacks.</p> <p>What began as a defense project quickly turned academic. By the early \u201970s, ARPANET hosted email, file transfers, even the first awkward stabs at online chat. Membership was tightly controlled: government agencies, universities, research labs. Having an ARPANET account meant you were inside a small, privileged circle trusted by the Pentagon.</p> ARPANET in its formative years: a sparse, elite graph of trust. <p>By 1978, that circle had grown to a few hundred nodes. The users were scientists, grad students, systems managers, defense contractors... the very people who decided which machines their institutions would buy. Logging on conferred status: technically fluent, institutionally powerful, and, coincidentally, DEC\u2019s perfect customer profile.</p> <p>The network wasn\u2019t a marketplace. It was a curated guest list. For a marketer like Gary Thuerk, it looked like destiny.</p> <p>IV. The Father of Spam</p> <p>Gary Thuerk wasn\u2019t an engineer. He studied business at the University of Massachusetts and joined DEC through the marketing track. His job was to move machines, not design them: booking demo halls, organizing roadshows, finding the people who could sign purchase orders.</p> <p>By the mid-1970s he was a young manager in DEC\u2019s Marlboro office, ambitious and audacious. Engineers at DEC often treated marketing as ornamental, but Thuerk believed in the leverage of getting the message right. He wanted to prove that marketing could matter as much as circuitry.</p> <p>By spring 1978, he spotted an opening. ARPANET wasn\u2019t just a research tool; it was a ready-made address book of the very people who decided which minicomputers to buy. One list, hundreds of decision-makers. For Thuerk, it looked less like a network experiment and more like the most efficient invite list he\u2019d ever seen.</p> <p>V. The Day of the Blast</p> <p>On May 3, 1978, Thuerk pulled the trigger. DEC was hosting two events in San Francisco and Los Angeles to unveil the DECSYSTEM-20, a time-sharing descendant of the PDP-10. Instead of dialing phones or licking envelopes, he drafted a single ARPANET message.</p> <p>\u201cWe invite you to a presentation of the new DECsystem-20 family of systems, the most powerful interactive minicomputers in the world\u2026\u201d</p> <p>The invitation went out to 393 recipients. ARPANET\u2019s mail program, never designed for mass lists, buckled under the load. Addresses spilled into the body of the message, creating a messy block of exposed hostnames; a digital equivalent of printing the guest list on the front of the envelope.</p> <p>Embarrassing? Yes. Disqualifying? No. The important part had already happened: the blast had cleared the machine and landed in hundreds of inboxes.</p> <p>VI. Pandemonium</p> <p>The response was swift \u2014 and hostile. ARPANET was funded by the Department of Defense and reserved for research and collaboration. Commercial use broke a shared norm.</p> <p>Administrators erupted. Memos flew. One captured the mood:</p> <p>\u201cThis was a flagrant violation of the ARPANET\u2026 advertising of particular products should be strongly discouraged.\u201d</p> <p>Thuerk\u2019s colleagues bristled as well. In a company where engineering ruled and marketing survived on sufferance, he had committed a cultural felony.</p> <p>His bosses at DEC scolded him. But they didn\u2019t fire him.</p> <p>And that detail is the key. From the very beginning, spam was condemned in public and rewarded in private. Thuerk himself later claimed the blast generated $10\u201314 million in sales. For a single email, that\u2019s a staggering return. Outrage on the surface, results underneath. That dynamic has shaped the industry ever since.</p> <p>VII. The Paradox of the First Spam</p> <p>Forget the caricature of the clueless spammer. Gary Thuerk was a sharpshooter. The product was real. The audience was perfect. The event mattered. And the numbers proved it: millions in revenue flowed from that single unsolicited send.</p> <p>He got the \u201cwho\u201d and the \u201cwhat\u201d exactly right. He just got the \u201cwhere\u201d catastrophically wrong.</p> <p>ARPANET was a members-only club built on trust, not a marketplace open to bids. It was a space for collaboration, and his message was a commercial intrusion. Consent wasn\u2019t just missing; the very idea of it was alien to the network\u2019s culture.</p> <p>This is why the first spam is spam. It\u2019s the original sin of confusing audience with permission. The content was relevant, but the context was violated.</p> Gary Thuerk, the father of spa... e-marketing. <p>VIII. The Legacy</p> <p>History has been less kind than the balance sheet. Gary Thuerk is remembered as the \u201cFather of Spam,\u201d a title he resents. He prefers \u201cthe first e-marketer.\u201d A technically accurate claim, but one that history has emphatically ignored.</p> <p>DEC\u2019s path adds its own irony. The company dominated the 1980s, then missed the personal computer wave. By the late 1990s, Compaq absorbed DEC, and HP later absorbed Compaq. The old mill in Maynard outlived the empire it once housed.</p> <p>Thuerk himself went on to work in marketing and consulting, giving occasional interviews about \u201cthe first spam.\u201d He never stopped insisting that the campaign was smart, targeted, and effective. But he also never escaped the label that history pinned on him.</p> <p>IX. Clean Outbound, Dirty Beginnings</p> <p>Spam began in sophistication: a clever reading of a new medium. A marketer saw a dense cluster of high-value prospects and reached for the newest channel. Commercially, it worked. Culturally, it backfired.</p> <p>The tension persists. We call the alternative Clean Outbound: earn attention, don\u2019t assume it. You can nail targeting, timing, even relevance, and still land as noise.</p> <p>Thuerk\u2019s bosses scolded him, then let the results speak louder. That was the lesson the industry absorbed: when the payoff is big enough, ethics and brand reputation are negotiable. Incentives, not norms, set the direction. And they still do.</p> <p>That contradiction\u2014condemned and rewarded\u2014is outbound\u2019s original sin. It began in a Massachusetts mill, with a marketer who thought like an engineer, an invitation that seemed harmless, and an inbox that suddenly didn\u2019t feel so clean.</p>","tags":["history","sales","spam","ethics","outbound"]}]}
