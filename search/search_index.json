But it doesn't have to be.</p> <p>Published: August 7, 2025</p> <p>Sales, as a human occupation, is essential and fundamentally good. At its core, sales is about helping people discover, understand, and ultimately buy the products or solutions a company offers. The very fact that customers willingly complete these transactions is proof enough that these products deliver real value. Seen this way, sales acts as a lubricant, a catalyst: it shortens the gap between potential value\u2014the promise of what the product could do\u2014and realized value, which the customer experiences once they purchase and use it.</p> <p>The world simply cannot function without sales.</p> <p>And yet, sales often ends up dirty, and cold outbound sales is particularly so. It generates pollution in the same way a chemical plant produces waste. To manufacture a profitable compound, the factory inevitably creates byproducts. When that waste is discharged into a river, the cost isn\u2019t borne by the factory but passed downstream to communities living beside it.</p> <p>Economists call this a negative externality: a cost imposed on third parties who neither chose nor benefit from the transaction.</p> <p>Noise pollution is another example. A nightclub generates profit for its owners and entertainment for its customers, while neighbors\u2014who didn\u2019t vote for any of it\u2014lie awake at 3 AM, robbed of sleep and peace of mind. Worse still, as they stare at the ceiling, they can\u2019t help but picture the club owner raising a glass to a successful night.</p> <p>Outbound sales creates similar negative externalities, ones I\u2019ve always found hard to ignore when building sales operations. The pollution isn\u2019t audible like noise or visible like waste, but it\u2019s just as real. It appears as overflowing inboxes, interrupted conversations, and minutes stolen from our concentration. Individually, these costs seem trivial. But multiplied millions of times, they become a burden carried by society\u2014imposed without consent or consultation, like those neighbors kept up by the nightclub.</p> <p>Companies evaluate outbound programs using familiar metrics: the volume of outreach (emails, calls), conversion rates into qualified leads, and the percentage of those leads that become paying customers. Success is declared when the total value of closed deals exceeds the cost of running the program.</p> <p>Those costs are typically calculated as the sum of data acquisition and validation, sales tooling (CRM, sequencing software, automation), outreach efforts (calls, emails, meetings), sales team compensation, marketing collateral, and, to a lesser extent, overhead like compliance and operations.</p> <p>What\u2019s never tallied in this equation are the costs outbound pushes onto everyone else. But if they were factored in\u2014using the same cold numerical logic we apply to leads, deals, and returns\u2014outbound might be designed very differently.</p> <p>There\u2019s another dynamic at play in cold outbound, one that mirrors a well-known dilemma from environmental science.</p> <p>The tragedy of the commons, a concept popularized by ecologist Garrett Hardin in the 1960s, describes how shared resources tend to be overused when individuals act in their own immediate self-interest. In Hardin\u2019s example, several shepherds graze animals on a common pasture; each benefits by adding more livestock, but the damage from overgrazing is shared by all. Eventually, the resource collapses\u2014and everyone loses.</p> <p>Sales faces a similar dynamic. The common pasture is customer attention. These are people who might genuinely benefit from our product, if we could just hold their interest for a few minutes. But that same customer lives in a swarm of competing offers, each salesperson acting rationally by sending one more email, making one more call, leaving one more message.</p> <p>The result: an ecosystem choking on excess. Attention\u2014once relatively abundant\u2014has become scarce, expensive, and increasingly immune to capture, another casualty of a system that generates value by offloading its costs on time, focus, and consent at massive scale.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.</p> <p>The assumption that waste is an unavoidable byproduct of sales isn\u2019t a law of nature. It\u2019s a consequence of how we choose to operate: how we build teams, run programs, and measure success.</p> <p>So: is it possible to build a truly Clean Outbound?</p> <p>That\u2019s the question I explore on these pages: whether outbound programs can be reimagined to drastically reduce the negative externalities we\u2019ve come to accept as normal\u2014and, just as critically, whether they can match or even outperform the effectiveness of the conventional, \u201cdirty\u201d systems that dominate today.</p> <p>Because unless it delivers real results, Clean Outbound is just another elegant theory collecting dust.</p>","tags":["sales","ethics","outbound","externalities","attention","systems"]},{"location":"posts/parasitic-sales/","title":"Parasitic Sales","text":"<p>How companies hijack your instincts to keep you on the line</p> <p>Published: August 11, 2025</p> <p>A visitor in the nest</p> <p>The cuckoo watches from a hidden perch, waiting for the warbler to leave its nest. As soon as the coast is clear, she flies in, lays her egg in seconds, and takes off, often carrying away one of the originals to keep the number the same.</p> <p>Soon after, the warbler returns. Inside are eggs that look exactly like hers. She settles in, warming them without the slightest suspicion.</p> <p>The match is so close the warbler does not notice the intrusion. That cuckoo egg hatches earlier than the rest, revealing a chick already larger and stronger. Within days, it pushes the other eggs, her own offspring, out of the nest entirely.</p> <p>She continues to feed it because the cuckoo chick has evolved to trigger her parental instincts with ruthless precision. The colour of its gape, the pitch of its begging call, and the timing of its hunger are tuned to match or outcompete her own young. Evolutionary biologists call this brood parasitism, the exploitation of one species\u2019 instincts by another.</p> <p>Richard Dawkins, in The Selfish Gene, uses the cuckoo as a vivid example of how natural selection favours strategies that exploit pre-wired behaviours. What\u2019s striking is not that the warbler loses, but that it loses by doing exactly what it has evolved to do. The cuckoo does not need speed or force. It wins by presenting the right signals in the right sequence and letting instinct carry out the rest.</p> <p>The deception works because it targets instincts that cannot be switched off. Even when the truth is obvious, the impulse to feed still wins \u2014 much like picking up the phone out of habit when an unfamiliar number flashes on the screen.</p> <p>Our own wiring</p> <p>We like to think of ourselves as different from the warbler. After all, we\u2019ve got consciousness, reasoning, choice. Surely that protects us from being manipulated by a beak and some chirping.</p> <p>But we also run on instincts \u2014 survival mechanisms shaped over hundreds of thousands of years in an environment where living in a group was the difference between life and death. Politeness, reciprocity, and conflict avoidance weren\u2019t \u201cnice-to-haves.\u201d They were survival code. In small, tightly knit groups, returning a favour kept you in good standing. Avoiding unnecessary conflict meant fewer injuries and stronger cooperation when hunting or defending the group. Responding when addressed signalled awareness and respect, reinforcing bonds that might one day save your life.</p> <p>Over many generations, these behaviours became second nature, reinforced by the survival advantages they brought in the ancestral environment. Those same reflexes now operate in a world of call queues, unknown numbers, and scripted pitches. And like the warbler\u2019s feeding reflex, they can be triggered by the right cues, whether or not the source is genuine.</p> <p>The phone rings</p> <p>Your phone rings. The number\u2019s unfamiliar.</p> <p>You could ignore it, but curiosity, another ancient instinct, taps you on the shoulder. You pick up. The voice on the other end is warm, confident, friendly. They use your name. They ask how you are, and you answer automatically, even though you\u2019ve never met. Only a few seconds in do you realise this is the electricity company, the one that calls every few months with a \u201cspecial rate\u201d that somehow always turns out higher than the one you have now.</p> <p>There\u2019s a shift: part irritation, part guilt. You want to hang up. You also don\u2019t want to be rude. It\u2019s a small but effective trap. You know you don\u2019t want what they\u2019re offering \u2014 yet the polite thing to do, the instinctive thing, is to hear them out.</p> <p>A fine-tuned system</p> <p>The only thing that matters to the people running it is conversion. And conversion goes up when you stay on the line. Whether it\u2019s because the person in charge of outbound is consciously borrowing from the cunning of the cuckoo, or simply the cumulative result of decades of trial and error in call centres (just like biological evolution), we\u2019ve ended up with a system that essentially hijacks your social instincts.</p> <p>The friendly opening. The first-name greeting. The pace and tone of the voice. Each detail tested, refined, and sharpened until it tugs at your wiring just enough to keep you from hanging up.</p> <p>What I find most irritating is that the people who sign off on these tactics will never face you. They don\u2019t hear the sigh in your voice or feel the tension of staying polite while someone burns your time. That part is outsourced to the people on the phones, often underpaid, under pressure, and not to blame for the strategy they\u2019re carrying out.</p> <p>Your frustration has nowhere to go. You hang up, but the system remains untouched. And each call makes you fractionally quicker to cut the next one short.</p> <p>The numbers</p> <p>In Q1 2025, consumers in North America and Europe were hit with 12.5 billion spam and fraud calls; about 137 million a day. Spam now makes up 44 % of unidentified calls in France, 42 % in Spain, and 22 % in the U.S. (Hiya, Q1 2025; Q3 2023).</p> <p>So it\u2019s no surprise that 94 % of European consumers believe unidentified calls are likely spam or fraudulent (Hiya/GSMA, 2022). The share of adults who usually answer unknown numbers has collapsed over the last decade \u2014 to 19 % in the U.S. (Pew, 2020) and 28 % in the UK (YouGov, 2022) \u2014 and the real surprise is that those figures aren\u2019t even lower.</p> <p>Each unwanted call trains us to be quicker to hang up\u2014or never pick up\u2014on the next one.. The damage compounds, and over time answer rates fall and conversion follows. No amount of brand spend buys that back. The irony is that companies can spend millions polishing their brand and, in the same quarter, grind it down with tactics that make people less likely to ever pick up again.</p> <p>Just hang up the phone</p> <p>If a reed warbler could suddenly understand the cuckoo\u2019s trick, it wouldn\u2019t hesitate. It would shove the cuckoo chick over the edge the moment it recognised the threat.</p> <p>The chick itself isn\u2019t the villain, but it\u2019s still part of a parasitic system. Same with the voice on the line: they\u2019re just the visible part of a machine built to drain your time for someone else\u2019s gain.</p> <p>Once you spot the pattern, hanging up is not only perfectly reasonable \u2014 it\u2019s an act of self-protection. Your attention and goodwill are finite, and the system is designed to spend them. You\u2019re under no obligation to feed it.</p>","tags":["ethics","sales","outreach","behavioural-science"]}]}
